A more deadly sexually transmitted disease worse than HIV AIDS has been released from the kingdom of darkness. We need to be very prayerful and careful.</p><p>2. I see more Disasters taking place this year. But God will preserve His children.</p><p>3. America and Europe must pray fervently in this year.&nbsp;I see the rise of religious fundamentalism in Europe, and serious crisis with the US elections. If care is not taken, there may not be an election in America. I see Obama suddenly changing his mind to run for 3 term, sparking off serious crisis. They must pray to avert all these.</p><p>4. Nigeria must pray for a former military head of state. Seems like the end of the road.</p><p>5. I see a calendar representing the entertainment industry- some prominent people have been marked with the circles on the calendar for death.We seriously need to pray for the entertainment industry.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Blind Prophet Releases 2016 Prophecy About Buhari</p><p>6. I see Nigerian Football returning to glory days.</p><p>7. I see explosions in places that no one is expecting to see them, in Nigeria. We need to pray for the Southern part of Nigeria.</p><p>8. I see a former minister passing on this year and also a present minister going home.</p><p>9. We need to pray for Rivers and Akwa-Ibom states- that God should avert any crisis arising from election re-runs that may eventually happen in those states. I see terrible bloodshed. But if we pray, the opposite will be the case.</p><p>10. Anyone who wants to retain political power this year must seek the face of God.</p><p>11. We need to pray for Kogi state. I see someone sworn in and later eliminated prematurely. Serious intervention needed.</p><p>12. Lots of families will experience generational blessings for the first time this year.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong>Primate Ayodele Drops Fresh Predictions</p><p>13. I see a country in Europe having to deal with a major crisis resulting from a fatal train crash with heavy casualties.</p><p>14. Lots and lots of barren women will rejoice this year; because God has released unto them fruitfulness beyond measure.</p><p>15. Our men in uniform, especially the Police Force and the Nigerian Military must embark on serious prayers… there will be some serious shaking this year, in those two divisions.</p><p>16. Terror attack will increase in Nigeria but solution will arise between the 7 and 8month of this year- 2016.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhHN8kG9pZquVmnqltdKaqq2doqh6psTPpaasoZ%2BjwG7DyKWjZqyRoLJuvMuamp5lYmV%2Bd3nPqKeupJGnerGt0q2mq2WimsOmrcusZKyspaO7qrrGZqerp6CdsqS1xKxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./savannah-chrisley-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Does Savannah Chrisley's Net Worth Compete With Her Dad Todd's?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./high-court.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About High Court On Naija News</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
