Baby followed it up with <i>God’s Work</i> mixtape series, <i>Baby Talk</i> mixtape series, <i>Billion Dollar Baby</i>, and <i>Back on My Baby Jesus Sh*t</i>.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, the rapper went by a different name when he was starting his music career. He performed under the name Baby Jesus for a while before changing it to DaBaby.
