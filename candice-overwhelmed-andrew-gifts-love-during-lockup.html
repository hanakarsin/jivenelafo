Charles Manson famously had several girlfriends, and even literal ladykiller Ted Bundy was on the receiving end of his fair share of love letters. According to Psychology Today, who spoke with Melissa Fazzina, creator of Canadian Inmates Connect, most women are looking for a deeper connection that they get through letters and phone calls. They also don't have to commit themselves fully to the norms of a relationship.</p><p>As far as men falling for female prisoners goes, I have a cynical theory. I'm sure some men are lonely because we are in the midst of a loneliness epidemic. However, I suspect the idea of more or less having full control over the relationship is very appealing for some men, especially if they're the jealous type. Could this be the case for Andrew and Candice on <a href=#>Love During Lockup</a>? In this exclusive clip obtained by Distractify, Andrew gives Candice some expensive gifts but it doesn't go very well.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube/WE tv</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Candice is very overwhelmed by Andrew's pricey gifts.</h2><p>"It wasn't my intention to be financially supported by Andrew," says Candice during a confessional. "Once we started talking in prison, he started sending me money without me even asking." Touched by this gesture, Candice said she planned to use the money to buy herself sheets and a pillow as she was without either. This prompted Andrew to ask Candice what else she needed and suddenly they were off to the fully funded races.</p><p>This clearly established a pattern in their relationship which makes sense because Andrew lived thousands of miles away from Candice's prison in Nevada. Providing her with money which in turn could be used to make her prison time more comfortable was one of the few ways he could express his love. Now that Candice is free, Andrew is keeping up with his old patterns but it seems as if Candice isn't as agreeable in the real world.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>As she's perched on top of a black truck, which I assume is the same vehicle he bought for her, Andrew hands Candice a Louis Vuitton purse that probably cost him around $2,000. She then pulls out a wallet and a new cell phone. On Candice's left hand is a pretty large engagement ring. By all accounts, Andrew is really dipping into his $180,000 401K to make her 401Day.</p><p>Unfortunately Candice more overwhelmed than overjoyed by the lavish gifts. She thanks Andrew but he can tell something is wrong. "Are you OK," he asks. "This is a lot," responds Candice. To his credit, Andrew does say that if it's too much he has no problem taking a step back. "You don't have to step back," she says. "I need a minute to adjust."</p><p>You really feel for Andrew who has given up a lot to make this relationship work. On the one hand, setting up Candice's post-prison life is very sweet. On the other hand, he has created a scenario where she almost entirely depends on him for survival. That's never a good situation to be in, especially if you're a woman. Will things work out? I will definitely be tuning in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vsMicnGanppq%2FuLTEpaSenF2Wu6W%2BxLBkoKGWqcBuuM6vnGacpae2r7OMpaaco6Wl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-lynch-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Lynch - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./318961-nhif-dependent-registration-how-add-dependents-easily-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>NHIF dependent registration: How to add dependents easily</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
