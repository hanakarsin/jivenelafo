But now, their reach goes far beyond the long-running reality series.</p><p>As Drew welcomes his second child with wife Linda Phan while Jonathan gears up for his nuptials with <a href=#>Zooey Deschanel</a>, fans of the twins wonder how much money they’ve made throughout their career and what their net worth is.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Drew and Jonathan Scott, aka “The Property Brothers,” have an estimated combined net worth of $200 million.</h2><p>While $200 million might not seem crazy high for two real estate moguls and television personalities, the brothers put a lot of money into their artistic and philanthropic endeavors. Plus, who needs more than a few million dollars anyway? In fact, Drew and Jonathan started life out as working middle-class brothers who have been hustling since they were just 7 years old.</p><p>The Property Brothers grew up in Canada after their father emigrated from Scotland with dreams of becoming a cowboy. Their dad, Jim, worked in the film industry and the boys wanted to follow in his footsteps. But first, they learned how to work. Drew and Jonathan started a business, JAM, that sold nylon-covered hangers at just 7 years old.</p><p class="sc-bA-DUxO bSiVrH"><span>Drew and Jonathan Scott</span></p><p class="sc-jVSHhB eSHvkk">Television personalities, realtors, contractors</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $200 Million</p><p>Drew and Jonathan Scott, known also as the "Property Brothers," are most well-known for co-hosting their HGTV 'Property Brothers' franchise.</p><p><strong>Birth Names: </strong>Andrew Alfred Scott, Jonathan Silver Scott</p><p><strong>Birth Date: </strong>April 28, 1978</p><p><strong>Birth Place: </strong>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</p><p><strong>Mother: </strong>Joanne Scott</p><p><strong>Father: </strong>Jim Scott</p><p><strong>Spouse: </strong>Linda Phan (Drew married 2016)</p><p><strong>Children: </strong>Drew — Parker (b. 2022), Piper (b. 2024)</p><p><strong>Siblings: </strong>J.D.

They also worked as clowns, making as much as $100 per hour at parties and events. While Drew pursued sports, Jonathan pursued music, and while in college, they both garnered more interest in acting.</p><p>But to avoid becoming “starving artists,” they decided to invest in real estate. They bought their first property when they were only 18 years old with a $250 down payment, flipped it, rented it for a bit, and then sold it with a $50,000 profit, kickstarting what would become their lifelong career. There was no one else who could become the Property Brothers — they have the real estate and entertainment experience.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Drew Scott (@mrdrewscott)</a></p></figure><p>Through their various endeavors, they brought in cash from buying, flipping, and selling homes, as well as their television careers. While they had roles in their early years on Smallville and The X-Files, their star-making career began when they created Scott Brothers Entertainment, a production company with their older brother, J.D. Scott.</p><p>Cineflex first pitched Drew to host a real estate competition, but eventually, they developed Property Brothers with Jonathan, and after its success in Canada, HGTV made an offer to distribute.</p><p>Now, Property Brothers is one of the longest-running and most-watched shows on the network and has inspired several spin-offs that make up the Property Brothers franchise. They’re also the most highly-paid stars on HGTV, making $75,000–$150,000 per episode each. Their spinoffs include Buying and Selling, Brother Vs. Brother, and more.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jonathan Silver Scott (@jonathanscott)</a></p></figure><p>They’ve also created an app, the Property Brothers Handbook, and published books on finding and fixing properties. While Drew has been with his wife, Linda, since they met in 2010, Jonathan’s love life has been more inconsistent. However, he’s now engaged to actor Zooey, who is likely to boost his net worth once they marry and combine assets.</p><p>Because of Drew and Jonathan's work with Habitat for Humanity, they were selected for the organization’s highest honor, Habitat Humanitarians. They also worked with Michelle Obama on her “Let’s Move” campaign and have donated large sums to St. Jude’s and other pediatric cancer initiatives and charities. So even though they seem to have endless money, at least they’re putting it to good use!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpb%2BwvMSrq7Jlkqe8tbTEq6pmppWperi70a2f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./naomiibrook-tiktok.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Naomiibrook?
