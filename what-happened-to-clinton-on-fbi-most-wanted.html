A few ventured so far as to name the scenes in which they thought he would have done particularly well.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I wish Clinton Skye would've been at the bachelor party #FBIMostWanted," tweeted an FBI: Most Wanted fan named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheKevNation</a> on Jan 26, 2021, the day "The Line" aired.&nbsp;</p><p>"Where is Clinton?

He will appear in a short movie directed by Ian David Nsenga, titled Tipping Point, a Western, The Silver Thimble Gang, and a TV series starring Verity Butler, Rebecca Holopter, and others, titled Soiled Doves. One possible explanation holds that Nathaniel had to spend some time away from the shooting of FBI: Most Wanted to focus on his other projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HITC</a>, the actor might be facing scheduling difficulties resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Dozens of shows were temporarily put on hold in the spring of 2020. Some clashes likely occurred when the studios reopened, which may have affected Nathaniel as well. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The actor has yet to address the reasons behind his sudden disappearance from the police procedural drama on Instagram or Twitter. However, most fans seem to believe that he is only taking a short break from the shooting — and that he will report for duty once again in the near future. His IMDb page doesn't list the forthcoming FBI: Most Wanted episodes in which he will appear, however, and the exact date of his return is unknown at present.&nbsp;</p><p>Nathaniel's temporary disappearance from the show is far from the only casting-related development taking place, however. Yellowstone actress Jen Landon landed a recurring role on Season 2 of FBI: Most Wanted in January 2021, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Catch new episodes of FBI: Most Wanted every Tuesday at 10 p.m. ET on CBS.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScpJmjwbC6jKilZp6Snnquu9KtZLCZnqmypQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./richard-norton-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Richard Norton - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./conor-bradley-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Conor Bradley - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
