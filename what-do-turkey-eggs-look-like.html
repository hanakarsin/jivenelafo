Let’s talk turkey. As <a href=#><u>Thanksgiving Day</u></a> approaches, many people have plans to sit down to a traditional Thanksgiving feast. For most, that means turkey. As I was thinking about turkey (as I so often do), I had a startling realization. I have no idea what a turkey egg looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>I mean, turkeys are birds. Obviously. So they lay eggs. But what do those eggs look like? And where are they? I don’t know about you, but I have certainly never seen a turkey egg in a grocery store. And so, I set out to discover the answer to what is maybe the most bizarre question I’ve ever asked myself: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>What do turkey eggs look like?</u></a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do turkey eggs look like?</h2><p>In this, the age of the Google search, it wasn’t difficult to find an answer to my question. As it turns out, turkey eggs look a lot like, you know, eggs. They are slightly larger than chicken eggs and typically have brown speckles. Check out the picture above so you, too, can know what a turkey egg looks like.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Modern Farmer</u></a>, the shells of turkey eggs are slightly tougher than the shells of chicken eggs. The membrane between the egg and the shell is also a bit thicker. On average, a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>turkey egg</u></a> is between 2 and 2.7 inches long and can weigh between 66 grams and 110 grams. So, that answers my first question. I think we can all agree the next question is obvious.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can you eat turkey eggs?</h2><p>Yes! You can eat turkey eggs! You can use them instead of chicken eggs for baking, too. In most cases, you can substitute two turkey eggs for three chicken eggs. They reportedly taste very similar to chicken eggs. Which, now that I think about it, isn’t that surprising. What else would they possibly taste like?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So then, why don’t we eat turkey eggs?&nbsp;</h2><p>Who knew we’d all be learning so much about turkey eggs today? Anyway, we know what turkey eggs look like, and we know they’re edible, so why aren’t we eating them? As it turns out, getting turkey eggs into the egg market would be both complicated and expensive. First of all, while a chicken usually lays one egg every day, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a turkey only lays about two eggs per week.</u></a></p><p>Turkeys also require more food and more space than chickens (because they’re usually bigger than chickens). And while chickens start laying eggs when they are 5 months old, turkeys don’t start laying until they hit about 7 months. All of these factors combined mean that turkey eggs are just all-around more expensive to produce than chicken eggs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>American Farm Bureau Federation</u></a>, conventionally produced chicken eggs cost $1.25/dozen. Obviously, this price varies depending on where you buy them, and on whether you are willing to shell out (get it?) for organic/free-range/cage-free eggs. Turkey eggs, on the other hand, cost approximately $3... each.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>No one wants to spend $3 for an egg that is basically just a bigger, speckled chicken egg. Thus, it makes more sense for turkey farmers to focus on fertilized eggs that turn into actual turkeys (which, in turn, become Thanksgiving dinner). So there you have it. That’s everything I know about turkey eggs. Now you know it too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpmaspae4psWMnp6gq12hvLC3jKWgpJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./star-trek-picard-spinoff.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will There Be a 'Star Trek: Picard' Spinoff in the Future?
