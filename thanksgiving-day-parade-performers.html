Now, as the world begins to rebound from a deadly pandemic, 2021's event is shaping up to be truly amazing.</p><p>This year's lineup of performers is epic, to say the least, and we're breaking down who you can expect to see. Although there are always more celebrities who just happen to pop up at the event, the ones that we know will for sure be in attendance already have the makings of a great show. Read on for a list of the Thanksgiving Day parade performers at this year's event!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. Carrie Underwood</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If there's one thing that's clear, it's that country music is going to have a significant presence at this year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Starting off the list of stars that will be in attendance is <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>. It's likely that Carrie will begin her performance with a track from "My Gift," her hit Christmas album which was re-released as a special edition in September 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Kim Petras</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>One of the other big names joining the list of stars at this year's parade is <a href=#>Kim Petras</a>. The German-born pop star will be performing alongside a group called Boss Kids. The "Boss" part of their name stands for "Born Original Striving Successfully." The kids will join her on a float while she sings.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Kristin Chenoweth</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Known best for her appearance as Glinda the Good Witch in Broadway’s Wicked in 2004, <a href=#>Kristin Chenoweth</a> has taken part in the parade quite a few times before. The singer/actress has appeared in some capacity during the event in 2005, 2008, 2013, and now will be again in 2021.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Darren Criss</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Another big name joining the lineup of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade for the first time in 2021 is <a href=#>Darren Criss</a>. Known for his breakout role in Glee, Darren is a respected singer and performer who recently released his first-ever holiday album, "A Very Darren Christmas." Details on the performance haven't been specified, but it's likely that Darren will perform something from that album in the spirit of the holidays.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Andy Grammer</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Another veteran of multiple Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parades, <a href=#>Andy Grammer</a> has performed at both the 2015 and 2017 parades and is now taking on his third gig in the streets of The Big Apple in 2021. Most recently, Andy has been making the rounds performing new songs such as "Lease on Life" and "Damn It Feels Good to Be Me," which are both set to be a part of his long-awaited fifth full-length album.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Nelly and Kelly Rowland</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although it hasn't been officially confirmed that <a href=#>Nelly</a> and <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a> will be performing together at the 2021 parade, it would just make a whole lot of sense if they did. Nearly 20 years after their hit collaborative song "Dilemma" was released, fans may very well be in for a brand new live rendition of the track.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7.
