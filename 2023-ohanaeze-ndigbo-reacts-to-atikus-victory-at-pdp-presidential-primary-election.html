Nobody is going to take the risk of campaigning for Atiku in the East since the PDP is now a regional northern political party. Atiku will not have Igbo support him in 2023, he cannot be the President of Nigeria in 2023.</p><p>“Ndigbo will rise against PDP and Atiku Abubakar as a prize for PDP’s ingratitude and dishonesty against Igbo,”&nbsp;Ohanaeze added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FyZmtoYmh6sLTAp5iespViu6W1xpumZqqVlrC1v4ytpmaZpJ64tr%2BMr6CcrJ%2Bnxm6t02annahdpb%2Bmv8idnKesmZa5brzRoqSaqqlisq2xwq2gqKZf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./policemen-catch-fun-as-hoodlums-fight-dirty-in-agbado-area-of-lagos-videos.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Policemen 'Catch Fun' As Hoodlums Fight Dirty In Agbado Area Of Lagos</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./trashed-28.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian Government Destroys 329,000 Chickens In 62 Farms Over Bird Flu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
