So, how many times has Clare been on The Bachelor or one of its spinoffs? Well, we certainly hope the fifth time's the charm. Here’s the Bachelor Nation history of this fan favorite.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘The Bachelor’ Season 18</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Craig Sjodin/ABC</span></figure><p>Clare was an early favorite during Juan Pablo Galavis’ season of The Bachelor and even came in second place, behind Nikki Ferrell. Her relationship with the Venezuelan soccer player turned dramatic when he seemingly shamed her for their hook-up in the ocean. And then came that infamous helicopter ride.</p><p>“So as the helicopter’s landing, we have a rare moment together with no cameras, nobody there with us and Juan Pablo leaned over and whispered something to me,” Clare explained on air. “He chose to tell me something that no woman wants to hear. It was insulting, it was offensive, and it just made me feel awful.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>As she left the show in the season finale, Clare gave Juan Pablo a kiss-off: “I’ll tell you what. I thought I knew what kind of man you were. What you just made me go through? I would never want my children having a father like you.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Bachelor in Paradise’ Season 1</h2><p>The hairstylist was one of the Bachelor Nation all-stars who headed to Mexico for the debut season of Bachelor in Paradise. In Tulum, she joined Robert Graham and Chris Bukowski for dates, but it was Zack Kalter who really caught her eye.</p><p>Despite those sparks, Clare left Paradise after enduring ambivalence from Zack and slut-shaming from costar AshLee Frazier. (“She had sex in the ocean,” AshLee had told Zack. “That speaks a lot to her character.”)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Bachelor in Paradise’ Season 2</h2><p>Clare returned to Paradise the following summer, going on dates with Mikey Tenerelli and Jared Haibon. But she cast aspersions about the other contestants not being there for the right reasons — angering costar Jade Roper in particular — and she was eliminated from the season halfway through.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘The Bachelor Winter Games’</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congratulations to Clare and Benoit! <a href=#>#TheBachelorWinterGames</a><a href=#>#WorldTellsAll</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/X182Lw1lSu</a></p>— The Bachelor Winter Games (@BachWinterGames) <a href=#>February 23, 2018</a></figure><p>In this four-part Bachelor spinoff — counterprogramming, of sorts, to the 2018 Winter Olympics — Clare entertained the affections of both Christian Rauch and Benoit Beauséjour-Savard. She and Benoit got engaged in the reunion special but announced their split a month and a half later.</p><p>“We think the world of each other, and we were both hoping we could make this work,” Clare said in a joint statement at the time. “I’m sorry that this may not be what you want to hear, but it’s our truth. Just know there are no negative feelings here, we are simply two people who believed in love, and were open enough to give it a chance.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘The Bachelorette’ Season 16</h2><p>Now Clare is back for another televised love journey, as ABC teased in a recent press release: “Clare is more than ready to put her romantic disappointments in the rearview mirror and start a wild ride to find her happily ever after."</p><p>Follow Clare's next journey on the season premiere of The Bachelorette, Tuesday, Oct. 13 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLmivsRmmquZp6GyunnHqK5mpZGjxm7AyKacrGWfo3qjrcKhnKWnog%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-playing-drums-for-the-rolling-stones.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keith Richards Reveals the Rolling Stones Are Recording New Music Without Charlie Watts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dario-argento-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dario Argento - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
