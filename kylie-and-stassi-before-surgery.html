They were both 11 years old at the time and quickly hit it off.</p><p>Kylie previously shared a photo from that meet-and-greet on her Instagram Story. "It all started when I met this beautiful bomb ass blonde at Barnes and Nobles," the reality star wrote. "This was our first pic together before we were friends."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>She added that Stassie spent so much time at her house during middle school and high school that it was almost like they lived together. "You basically became another sister," Kylie noted.</p><p>"You’ve been the most consistent and loyal friend in my life," the mother of one told Stassie during a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a> interview, "and I feel like without you, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. Because I wouldn’t be weird anymore. I’d be trying to be normal."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stassie is much more open about plastic surgery than Kylie.</h2><p>Kylie’s famously full lips, which she later admitted were achieved through fillers, helped launch her billion-dollar cosmetics brand, but the 22-year-old hasn’t confessed to getting more work done. Stassie, on the other hand, has always kept her nine million Instagram followers in the loop when it comes to going under the knife.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In 2017, she revealed that she had gotten a breast lift because her boobs were asymmetrical. "I used to have the cutest, perkiest boobs when I was young," the social media celeb explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harper’s Bazaar</a>.</p><p>"Someone had told me that if you wear an underwire bra it makes your boobs sag. I had cute boobs so I would never wear a bra," Stassie continued. "Overtime, I found out that whoever told me that was completely wrong."&nbsp;</p><p>One breast grew to be a full cup size larger than the other, but instead of getting implants, Stassie went with the lift to regain symmetry. "I was very open to sharing — plastic surgery is nothing be ashamed of," she said after the procedure.&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of people think plastic surgery is only for cosmetic reasons, to change something you're insecure about. All my comments were saying, 'you're so insecure, you're so insecure,'" she recalled, referring to internet trolls. "If I was insecure, I wouldn't have showed it."</p><p>Stassie later opted for implants, but confessed in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> last year that they were causing her problems. "I’m fixing my implants next Thursday. I’m having issues with my current ones," she explained in October. "I’m pretty sure it’s, like, bottomed-out or something… I’m just gonna get a little bit of a smaller [implant]."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoMattcRmmKecXajBor%2FSomSbnZakv6Z50q6poJ2irg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-nigerian-newspaper-headlines-for-today-saturday-6th-january-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top Nigerian Newspaper Headlines For Today, Saturday, 6th January, 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dued1-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dued1 - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
