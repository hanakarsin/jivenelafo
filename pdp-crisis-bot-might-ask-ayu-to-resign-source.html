And the speech he made when he was unveiling Okowa was very disappointing,” the source quoted Wike to have said.</p><p>The former national officer also said Wike told the BoT that Atiku came to London and assured him that Ayu would resign to balance things and then complained about the gang-up and sharing of positions which they had already done.</p><p>He continued that the BoT members were speechless after hearing Wike’s narration and better understood his point of how he has been wronged.</p><p>Wike was reported to have replied that the only way forward was for Ayu to resign and that if he didn’t, nobody should talk to him about PDP again, but vowed not to leave the party but also not to work for Atiku.</p><p>The source also noted how Wike was pained about how Atiku’s loyalist insulted him publicly and the former vice-president failed to caution them to order.</p><p>However, <strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that a member of the BoT Reconciliation Committee, <strong>Shuaibu Oyedokun</strong>, had revealed that the meeting of the advisory body would hold as soon as the committee’s report is ready.</p><p>Oyedokun said the committee was now ready to compile its report to be presented to the BoT, since they have visited all the governors in Wike’s camp as well as Atiku and his running mate.</p><p>“After compilation, we will submit our report to a larger BoT meeting which will consider it before submitting it to the NWC. The working committee will in turn present it to NEC (National Executive Committee),” Oyedokun stated.</p><p>In a Punch Newspaper report, the&nbsp; former Jigawa State Governor and NEC, Sule Lamido, came short of ruling out an immediate solution to the crisis saying, “It (reconciliation) is a continuous process up to the elections and even beyond.”</p><p>The report said like Lamido, a former National Vice Chairman (South-West) of the party, Eddy Olafeso, wants Nigerians to be patient with the party, stressing that the crisis would become a thing of the past in no distant time.</p><p>It will be recalled that the Acting BoT Chairman, <strong>Adolphus Wabara</strong> led other members including the former Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Relations, Tanimu Turaki,&nbsp; ex-Kogi State Governor, Ibrahim Idris, and four others to&nbsp; Port Harcourt on Tuesday to meet Wike for reconciliation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49wZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmmp%2Bpeq61xqGrZpmjoHqixdRmq6hloprAqrPNZqqoraKYsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./atiku-closes-case-against-tinubu-at-presidential-election-tribunal.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Atiku Closes Case Against Tinubu At Presidential Election Tribunal</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./405689-opinion-covid-19-kenya-ve-a-dark-patch-rise-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Opinion: COVID-19 at one in Kenya, we've been through a dark patch but still, we rise</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
