Yes, he is an RSO," he posted. "When he was 21, a 16-year-old girl accused him and others of SA when she was 11. Delaware took a plea deal. That's why there was no jail time, but he still had to register."</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sex offender registry</a> in Delaware, his real name is Charles Jefferson. He has a charge for "Rape Fourth Degree Sexual Intercourse," noting that the victim was between one and 11 at the time of the incident.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Here's the Truth.</p><p>Yes Delaware is my Brother-In-Law.

"Before being hired, Delaware sat down with Jimmy and Sue (Jimmy's Mom) and explained to them everything. So yes, Jimmy knew. But this incident happened in 2010, and Delaware was hired in 2017/2018. Delaware was also let go from the company before I was."</p><p>Jake continues to explain that Jefferson was "reluctant" to participate in videos, as he was hired as a "behind the scenes manager," but was ultimately asked to participate because "we needed people." Jake also claims the charges against Jefferson will be dropped this fall, though we cannot confirm the validity of this claim. The video featuring Jefferson is currently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still on MrBeast's channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJ2dnJbEor7EZqSrmpWWwLV5xKanpaepmrI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-dominique-claim-to-fame.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Dominique on 'Claim to Fame'?
