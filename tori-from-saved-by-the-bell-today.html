"Besides, new kids keep things fresh," he says. "Remember Tori?" ("Who?" replies Tiffani Thiessen's Kelly Kapowski.)</p><p>Leanna Creel played Tori Scott in 10 episodes of the original Saved by the Bell’s fourth season, and then the actress changed gears.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Leanna Creel started her own company.</h2><p>After Saved by the Bell ended, Leanna continued acting for a while, appearing in the films Freeway and The Cell, as well as episodes of the TV shows One West Waikiki and Ned and Stacey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span><p>Leanna Creel and 'Saved by the Bell' costar Dennis Haskins in 2018.</p></figure><p>She also segued into producing, earning an MFA in film production from UCLA and serving as a producer on the films Desert Blue, But I’m a Cheerleader, and Get Over It.</p><p>These days, however, Leanna is the founder of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Creel Studio</u></a>, a full-service production company specializing in travel and lifestyle photography.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She’s married to her business partner.</h2><p>The Creel Studio website also profiles her business partner and wife, Rinat Greenberg, a U.K. native who has worked in music video, commercial, film, and still photography production and who became a partner at Creel Studio in 2011.</p><p>"Rinat and Leanna also happen to be married … to each other.

"Mario [Lopez] liked to take his shirt off, and Mark-Paul wanted to have his hair be brown but the producers wouldn’t let him," she said. "I’m boring because I wasn’t part of any shenanigans.
