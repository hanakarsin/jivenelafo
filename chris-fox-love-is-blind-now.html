And what's he been up to since he left the pods? We've got the 4-1-1 on everything.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chris connected with Johnie during 'Love Is Blind' Season 5, but things didn't work out at first.</h2><p>As a refresher, Chris, who can be found on Instagram as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@chrisfoxxy</a>, is a project manager from the Houston area. He joined Love Is Blind after getting frustrated with dating apps and meeting women who "seem to not be looking for the commitment," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>. His longest relationship was three years prior to the show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the pods, he connected early on with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnie Maraist</a>, who is four years his senior. On several occasions, he claimed that he saw a future with her. But before he could pop the question, Johnie revealed to him that she had a stronger connection with one of the other men (<a href=#>Izzy Zapata</a>). Chris was devastated by the news and didn't hold back the tears.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Surprisingly enough, Johnie ended up meeting with Chris again, but only after things backfired with Izzy. Chris, understandably still hurt that Johnie didn't see him as her first choice, decided not to take her back or propose to her.</p><p>It was hard not to feel bad for Chris. He seemed kind and loyal. However, we're proud of him for standing his ground. Nobody wants to go into a marriage feeling like somebody's second choice.</p><p>However, in the second batch of episodes, we learned that Chris and Johnie met once they were outside of the pods and they started dating. He even admitted to loving her, at least at the time of filming.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">As of February 2023, Chris appeared to be dating someone. And it wasn't Johnie.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>We know that <a href=#>Season 5 of Love Is Blind was filmed in 2022</a>. And as of July of that year, Chris already seemed to be dating someone who wasn't Johnie. Although Chris's Instagram account remains sparse (likely because he was told to keep it impersonal until after the show airs), an account for a woman named Erin Berger has posts of the two of them together, dated as far back as July 2022 and as recently as February 2023.</p><p>"Appreciation post for my favorite person. I’ve got an insanely busy week ahead but I can always count on this guy to support me 100 percent. I love you <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@chrisfoxxy</a>," Erin's July 2022 caption reads.</p><p>Erin posted the two of them again for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Valentine's Day</a>, but that's the last post of them together. The rest of Erin's Instagram is full of pictures of her cute rescue kittens.</p><p>While it's unclear if Chris and Erin are still together, it's pretty safe to say that he and Johnie didn't stay together for long after the show finished filming. Hopefully, viewers get all the deets during the Love Is Blind Season 5 reunion, which is available to stream on Sunday, Oct. 15, on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdJmnaiwXaG8t7GMoqpmmpyeu6V5zaiu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-did-super-dave-osborne-die.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>An HBO Documentary About Super Dave Osborne Reveals Just How Super He Really Was</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./312371-top-30-latest-cornrows-hairstyles-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 30 latest cornrows hairstyles you should try in 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
