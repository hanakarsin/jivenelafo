The two are engaged, and everyone is so happy for them! Who is Chris Marek? What's his net worth? Here's everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Today it was announced that <a href=#>Little People, Big World star Amy Roloff </a>is engaged to her boyfriend, Chris Marek. According to PEOPLE, Chris popped the big question Wednesday night at one of their favorite restaurants. The couple met at a singles mixer about three years ago, and have been together since. You can watch an old clip of<a href=#> Little People, Big World that shows Amy</a> talking to her friend about her anxieties about dating again (she used to be married to Matt Roloff – the two got divorced May 2016 after being married for 27 years) before the mixer.</p><p>Turns out it wasn't exactly a meet cute between Chris and Amy — Amy was actually paired up with another guy named Bob. But eventually, Amy and Chris met and she became totally smitten with him after he asked her if she wanted to ride on his motorcycle with him</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Amy is over the moon about Chris. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She told PEOPLE</a>, "I'm so excited, I'm so surprised, I'm thrilled! I never in a million years thought I’d be getting married again, but I also hoped for it! Now that it’s happening, I couldn’t be happier or more excited." Chris said, "I was very nervous! It had to be a heart shaped diamond because I knew that’s what Amy wanted.” We couldn't be happier for the couple!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who exactly is Chris Marek?</h2><p>First off, we know that Amy's fiancé is 55 years old. He's also a real estate agent, and has been one for 20 years. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Trulia page</a>, Chris is part of the Knipe Realty team (although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his LinkedIn states</a> he's the owner of Keller Williams Real Estate), and he sells homes all over Oregon, including Aurora, Colton, and Beaverton. He seems really good at his job, too. One five-star review states, "Working with Chris was amazing! We appreciated his great communication skills and professionalism. He was always available and did a lot of extras to assist with the closing of our two properties. We would highly recommend working with him!"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Trulia</span></figure><p>According to Cafe Mom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris might originally be from Idaho</a>. He apparently went to Lewiston High in Lewiston, Idaho. Not much about his life pre-Amy is known — his social media pages are pretty private. The only public post we're able to see on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Facebook page</a> is the day he made it ~official~ with Amy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook/Chris Marek</span></figure><p>We do know that the couple is super outdoorsy and love a good adventure. Just a couple weeks ago, Amy posted an Instagram photo from a motorcycle trip. She wrote, "And the rest of an amazing motorcycle trip brought us to the magnificent and beautiful Crater Lake, Oregon’s only National park, covered bridges and then home. What a ride." The two love going on motorcycle trips together across the country. Back in August, they traveled down the coastline together.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/Amy Roloff</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What's Chris Marek's net worth?</h2><p>Earn the Necklace says that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris's main source of income</a> is his real estate business. How much income a real estate agent makes is based on where they sell homes, if they own their own agency, and, well, how good they are. According to Salary.com,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the average Oregon real estate agent income is $41,633</a> (and this is as of August 2019). However, we don't know if Chris had previous jobs or investments.&nbsp;</p><p>Amy, on the other hand, is estimated to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth $4.5 million</a>. Little People, Big World has been running for 13 years (and 14 seasons) on TLC, and her family also runs a farming business, Roloff Farms.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does Amy Roloff's engagement ring look like?</h2><p>Amy took to Instagram about 40 minutes ago (at the time of publication) to share her engagement ring. The photo of the heart-shaped diamond ring is beautiful, and Amy is glowing with happiness. "Guess what! I wanted to share with you- I’m engaged! ❤️❤️❤️. I was so surprised when Chris asked me to marry him. I said YES 😄💍. I couldn’t be happier and so looking forward to this new part of our life journey together. I’m blessed. Love you Chris," Amy wrote on Instagram.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Guess what!

It's mature of Matt to be able to set some of his (probably) complicated feelings aside and let his ex-wife enjoy this happy time. It's so clear that Amy and Chris are super in love.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrq6edGoo6ielmKyr7PAoJydZZOdv6q%2FjKaYq52b</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bbnaija-ill-break-erica-and-kiddwayas-relationship-prince-tells-biggie-video.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BBNaija: I'll Break Erica And Kiddwaya's Relationship</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./will-poulter-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Will Poulter - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
