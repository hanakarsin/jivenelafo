She even shared an onscreen kiss with then-29-year-old Keith Carradine (Nashville). Although the film and Brooke's performance were both critically acclaimed, Pretty Baby received backlash for its taboos.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In Lana Wilson's new documentary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields</a>, the Calvin Klein model recalls her harrowing experiences as a child sex symbol, a Lolita.</p><p>Many chastised Brooke's mother and manager (momager), Teri Shields, for thrusting her daughter into the limelight at such a young age. Brooke has mixed feelings on the issue. Here's what to know about The Blue Lagoon actor's parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brooke Shields' parents are Teri and Frank Shields.</h2><p>Brooke's mother and father divorced when she was an infant. Though Teri raised her, she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sunday Times</a> that she always wanted her businessman father to "be proud of [her]."</p><p>In fact, both the art of acting and Frank were Brooke's lifelines in the midst of her momager mother's lifelong battle with alcohol addiction. Teri's unpredictable behavior eventually led to emotional abuse.</p><p>"Making movies was always my safety net," she told the publication.</p><p>Teri allowed Brooke to pose nude for a Playboy publication at age 10 (yes, really), play a child sex worker at age 11 (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a role that saw her endure</a> grueling 12-to-15-hour workdays, painful antique footwear, and nine consecutive slaps across the face at the hands of costar <a href=#>Susan Sarandon</a>), and lead other films boasting sexual themes (The Blue Lagoon, Endless Love). However, Frank disapproved of these decisions but never vocalized his displeasure.</p><p>Brooke told The Sunday Times that her father was deep "in denial."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>When Brooke was accepted into Princeton University in 1983, her father was shocked.

I don’t know.” Brooke's own children view her early work as "child pornography."</p><p>And while the masses scolded Teri for her lenient parenting, Brooke feels no anger toward her mother, who died in 2012 following "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a long illness related to dementia</a>."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“Everyone always wanted me to be angry with her, but anger was just too sad for me to take when I looked at how insecure she was,” she shared. That being said, Brooke fired her mother in 1999.</p><p>Brooke's 2014 book, There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me, details her complicated, intense bond with Teri. Growing up, their relationship was so impassioned that Brooke "thought she was God."</p><p>"I thought she could change the weather. It was us against the world," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>.</p><p>Back in 2014, the Sahara star clarified that her New York Times bestselling memoir is not "a Mommie Dearest book."</p><p>“It’s so innate when you’re an only child of a single mother,” she told The Sunday Times. “All you want to do is love your parent and keep them alive forever, and so I wanted to protect her. And by virtue of protecting her, I was justifying everything, and that solidified that bond between us.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram/@brookeshields</span></figure><p>During a telling interview at the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety Studio</a>, Brooke opened up about the gut-wrenching feelings that came with losing her "controlling" mother. “You don’t ever recover from losing a parent,” she began. “It’s a primal thing. You learn to put it in a different place in your heart."</p><p>"I also said goodbye to her every time she drank," Brooke continued. "She wasn’t present. I knew who she was capable of being because it was in there."</p><p>The two-part documentary, Pretty Baby: Brooke Shields, premieres on Monday, April 3, 2023, on <a href=#>Hulu</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2Bwu8qeZKygmZq5pb%2BMqZirnZ6pwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sunday-igboho-fg-may-proscribe-yoruba-nation-group-just-like-ipob.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FG May Proscribe Yoruba Nation Group Just Like IPOB</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anwar-jibawi-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anwar Jibawi - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
