Fisher spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OprahMag.com</a> about the drama's potential continuation.</p><p>"Season 1 really did feel like a Season 1," Sarah said. "We just started uncovering some of the layers for all characters, across the board, that we want to dive into.

"Everything else in the middle was a fun discovery."</p><p>Though the show remained steady on Netflix's Top 10 list within the first few days of its release, Ginny & Georgia hasn't been without its fair share of controversy.</p><p>Many viewers criticized a scene between Ginny and her boyfriend, Hunter (Mason Temple), in which they discuss stereotypes. On the show, Hunter refers to the interaction as the "Oppression Olympics," a term that trended on Twitter soon after the show debuted on Netflix.</p><p>Fans also called out a comment made by Ginny about Taylor Swift, which shamed the singer's dating history.</p><p>When Georgia asks about Ginny's feelings toward Marcus (Felix Mallard), the teenager had a scathing retort.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"What do you care?" Ginny asks her mom. "You go through men faster than Taylor Swift."</p><p>In addition to the negative fan response, the "Bad Blood" singer herself actually tweeted about the joke, and how it is "sexist" toward women.&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back," Taylor tweeted, along with screengrab of the interaction on the show.</p><p>Ginny & Georgia is available to stream on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBus8inpbJlkaOxbrPEqKmgoZFir6K%2FxJ1kqKZdlnqju86k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./white-cat-memes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 'Woman Yelling at a Cat' Meme Will Seriously Make Your Day</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-ex-military-ruler-abubakar-makes-urgent-plea-to-all-nigerians.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ex-Military Ruler, Abubakar Makes Urgent Plea To All Nigerians</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
