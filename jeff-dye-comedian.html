If not, then maybe you were first acquainted with Jeff when he was spotted engaging in some PDA with reality star and recent divorcee <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Cavallari</a> in October of 2020.</p><p>Those who are in the latter camp are in luck, as we've rounded up all the information that you need to know about comedian Jeff Dye.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Before he started touring as a comedian, Jeff Dye knew he was passionate about making people laugh.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff was raised in Seattle,</a> according to his bio, and apparently, knew he wanted to pursue comedy early on. After his high school graduation, the former "class clown" started performing at Giggles Comedy Club, and three years later, he came in third on NBC's Last Comic Standing. Jeff then had two of his own MTV shows called Money Strangers and Numbnuts, later landed his own Comedy Central Presents special, and eventually had his own NBC series, Better Late Than Never.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>These days, when the novel coronavirus lockdown isn't happening, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff mostly spends his time touring across the country</a> to perform his stand-up comedy. According to the schedule on his website, prior to the pandemic, he had planned to travel across Michigan, Hawaii, Iowa, and Massachusetts from May through October. Hopefully, he'll be able to reschedule.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Jeff Dye dating anyone? Looks like he might be with Kristin Cavallari.</h2><p>You may remember back in 2018, when Jeff was dating two-time Smackdown Women’s Champion WWE superstar Becky Lynch. The two dated for a few years, but it seems as though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is now engaged to fellow WWE champion, Seth Rollins</a>, according to The Spun. He also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">apparently dated model Sara Jean Underwood</a> back in 2009, according to Who's Dated Who, but they broke things off within a year.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>It appears as if Jeff might have entered into another relationship with a public figure, as he was seen kissing Laguna Beach alum Kristin Cavallari outside of a bar in Chicago. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ </a>caught a video of the two locking lips at a bar located near one of Kristin's Uncommon James store locations. While it was initially unclear who Kristin's new man was, sources later confirmed to the outlet that it was Jeff Dye.&nbsp;</p><p>In April of 2020, Kristin announced that she was splitting from her husband of nearly seven years, Jay Cutler. The pair share kids Camden, Jaxon, and Saylor together.&nbsp;</p><p>Jay appeared on Kristin's E! reality series, Very Cavallari during its three-year run. Ahead of her divorce news, Kristin revealed that the show would not return for a fourth season.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeff Dye has his own podcast.</h2><p>Since 2018, Jeff has hosted his own podcast, called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Dye's Friendship Podcast</a>. It's produced by reVolver, and in each episode, Jeff brings on a new friend, interviews them, and obviously, hilarity ensues. According to a press release, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">each episode is filled with banter, funny conversations, and various special guests</a>, whether it's a fellow comedian, an athlete, or a cashier.</p><p>The podcast also features his trusty "sidekicks," who include stand-up comedian, Aaron Marsh, as well as his producer, Tony Reavis. While you may have a lot of podcasts on your plate right now, Jeff Dye's Friendship Podcast is uplifting and undeniably entertaining.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Jeff Dye's net worth?</h2><p>Between a variety of network TV shows, a podcast, and constant performances, it's safe to say Jeff's net worth is impressive. Back in 2016, Earn the Necklace estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his net worth amounted to approximately $19 million</a>, and it's most likely higher now, about three years, a full TV series, and several performances later.</p><p>Jeff is always pursuing new things, whether it's a new podcast topic, new tour dates, or even a new TV show. Needless to say, we'll be keeping our eye on him — he's always peaking our interest, no matter what he's up to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnsoydsJ5lk6S6prDImqU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-nightingale-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Nightingale - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./madison-lawlor-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Madison Lawlor - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
