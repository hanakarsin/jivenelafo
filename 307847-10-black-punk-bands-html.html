The music genre was originally heard in the United States, Australia, and Britain. Punk music was characterized by high pitched vocals, presence of guitars, electric bass, drums, and wild lyrics. Punk artists are known to have a distinct trend when it comes to fashion. Male artists are often in T-Shirts, motorcycle jackets, jeans, and boots. Female artistes rock similar outfits and complement their style with bold and dark makeup. Punk rock initially started as a Caucasian genre. For a while, no black artiste had emerged to sing or form a black punk band. Pure Hell and Death are credited as among the first punk bands which were made of people of colour. Other pioneer black punk bands include X-Ray Spex, Don Letts, Pure Hell, Bad Brains, and Death.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/bd1474b9aa4dbc75.jpeg><p class=align-left>Like other music genres, punk rock has evolved over the years. It was used to describe the garage musicians who made their art in the 60s. The late 70s and early 80s saw punk artistes establish themselves and go mainstream.
