You might have done it to others; you are about to learn a lesson if you touch me,” said Bakare.</p><p>“If you know what I have done in secret, bring it to the open. I dare you to come after me if you can. I worked with you; I worked for you; I supported you to get there (where you are). When I talk now, I now have a smelly mouth.</p><p>“I’m not interested in meeting you any longer; no more visits. Now, it is war, because Nigeria must be set free.”</p><p>Bakare did not mention the official he was referring to but Naija News reports that the cleric had backed President Buhari in 2015 and 2019. He had on numerous occasions met with Buhari at the presidential villa to discuss national issues.</p><h2>Failed three times</h2><p>Speaking further, the former VP candidate wondered if the official had forgotten what transpired between them when only himself and the official were alone in a room after the official had vowed never to contest the post he had contested and lost out on three occasions (Buhari had contested and lost the presidency on three occasions before winning in 2015).</p><p>Bakare added, “Have you forgotten that you vowed never to contest again. I said ‘not so’. I showed you how you can win the next election and you agreed to run and you won. I was not considering myself but concerned about how Nigeria can become great.</p><p>“Winning an election is a different thing; doing the right thing is another. No one must behave as if Nigeria is a personal property. Nigeria must be set free and any obstruction along the way must be removed; it must get out of the way.</p><p>“I declare to you ‘Nigeria-for-Nigeria Movement’. I’m prepared to lead this movement. Nigeria is not a one man property. This movement will liberate Nigeria.”</p><h2>Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu</h2><p>He slammed the Buhari government for clamping down on sectional agitators in the country, explaining, however, that he did not support any one or groups taking up arms against the state.</p><p>“I don’t support any act of violence, taking up arms against the country and killing people. Those are in the realm of criminality and anybody doing that must be brought to book,” Bakare said amid prayers and declarations,” Bakare said.</p><p>“However, we must realise that what has given rise to the agitation is lack of justice and equity. When there is justice, when there is equity, agitation will die down.</p><p>“How can you be expending so much energy on Igboho and Kanu? Igboho and Kanu are not Nigeria’s problems.</p><p>“Nigeria must restructure and no one can stop that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5FvZqytnpmuunnIoJmooJ9iu6%2BtzJ2gZqORo8JuwNSnm55lkpa4or7EZqmomaOpwG6yzquknqpdlrmtxYybrKGZop58</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacyandkacy-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacy and Kacy - Members, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ronald-dead-on-big-sky.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Brian Geraghty's Ronald Pergman Really Dead on 'Big Sky'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
