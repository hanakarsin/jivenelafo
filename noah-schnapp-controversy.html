His post began: "As a Jewish American, I am afraid. Afraid for my brothers and sisters in Israel who have been senselessly attacked by Hamas."</p><p>He continued to condemn the violence against Israel in his statement and expressed disappointment at the fact that he had received a slew of pro-violence comments from his fans after sharing a post of a young victim.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I just reposted a beautiful picture of a young innocent girl whose life was taken by Hamas at a music festival,‚Äù Noah wrote. He continued: "I was met with comments reading ‚Äòno one cares free Palestine‚Äô and ‚ÄòShe deserves that, and every Israeli terrorist deserves that ‚Äì Free Palestine.‚Äô I am outraged by the justification and celebration of the death of a young girls life. Have people lost their minds??? STOP!"</p><p>Ultimately, Noah asked his followers to "choose humanity over violence."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The comments were turned off on Noah's post, but his statement was met with criticism as some followers took to other social media platforms to call him out. It was the first line, in particular, where Noah wrote that he was afraid, which people found problematic. These followers claimed that Noah's pretending to care was disingenuous as he was a rich man living in a mansion in Los Angeles and nowhere near the current war zone.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He literally answers it in the next sentence?

The video featured fake presenters and claimed that "everyone is welcome, LGBTQH." The H was meant to represent Hamas.</p><p>In the caption, Noa wrote: "A huge part of our Jewish culture is using humor to deal with trauma. It helps with the pain. Please enjoy these pro-Hamas college students on their journey to normalize a massacre. Sigh."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Many viewers found the video to be Islamophobic and anti-gay.</p><p>That said, when Noah, who publicly came out as gay in January 2023, liked the video on Instagram, fans immediately noticed and criticized his interaction with the video.
