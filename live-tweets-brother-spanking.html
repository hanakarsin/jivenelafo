There was one problem: She did find out and when she caught up to him, there was hell to pay.</p><p>I grew up in an immigrant family's household where there was a certain rule of parenting and that rule was: If kids didn't do what they were told, then they better start praying to God because there'd be no one else around to help their sorry butts.</p><p>Seriously, I could never imagine ever, ever stealing something from under my parent's nose and expecting to get away with it scot-free. I remember freaking out one day and breaking down crying because I thought my father knew I was playing video games on a weekday.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: columbia</span></figure><p>See that still up above from the movie Mr. Deeds? Yeah, that was my mood whenever I came home with a less than straight-A report card or thought I had upset my father. To say "the fear was real" would be an understatement.</p><p>But for young Aaron, I guess the fear wasn't real enough. Judging by the way his mother reacted to the fact that he took her brand new car out for a joyride, I think he should've definitely known better.</p><p>His sister, Liza, live-tweeted the entire debacle for the rest of Twitter to enjoy, and she even played a part in the punishment. The story is an emotional rollercoaster and anyone with strict parents will be nodding their head to the whole thing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>First off, I have to admit that Aaron was slick in thinking that by disconnecting the Wi-Fi, his mother wouldn't see on the security camera that he creeped the Beemer out of his mom's house. I have to say, it is kind of sweet that he did it to show off to his girlfriend by popping by her house with it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>But unfortunately for him, Liza wasn't having any of that sibling-punishment-double-standard action, so when her mom wanted to unleash the fury of a parent scorned, she even provided the heavy artillery for his punishment: a dope-looking blue leather belt.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know if it makes it better or worse that the belt he is going to&nbsp;get beaten with is a nice one. When you see that strap raining down on you from above your mom's head, I can imagine how much of a mockery it would be for something so beautiful to cause so much pain.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Liza's mother coordinated with Aaron's girlfriend's mom to find out just where the young man went with her car so she could track him down and give him the belt-beatdown he'd earned for thinking he was slick and sneaking the car out of the house. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">You can check out the video of it here</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>She then got dad in on the conversation and updated him on their son's shenanigans. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If you want to watch the video</a>, just know that you don't need to speak or understand Spanish to know that the threat of a beatdown is very real, they even reference his sneakiness in shutting off the entire camera system at home so he could get up out of the house.&nbsp;</p><p>After driving around for a while, they finally find Aaron, and when her mom rolls down the window and lets out that angry scream, you know it's not going to end well for her joyriding son. Honestly, my face went white when I heard her yell.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>She walks to the car with the determination of a woman on a mission, and once that door is opened, well, that's nothing he can do to quell her wrath. After getting several slaps in she orders him out of the car. You can hear Liza laughing at her brother's misfortune before finally shutting off the camera. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the entire crazy video here</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Her clip understandably went viral, with several huge social media accounts reposting the footage of Aaron's beatdown. Liza says that her mom's become somewhat of a local legend after her tweets blew up. Which probably doesn't make Aaron feel any better about a potentially problematic situation with his girlfriend.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>You see, Aaron decided to go and do this boneheaded thing right before his school's homecoming dance, where he was planning on asking out his girlfriend to homecoming. Maybe rolling up in a Beemer was part of that process?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Even though he was grounded after being beaten with a belt,&nbsp;which isn't a good look for anyone trying to sweet-talk a love interest into attending a social function with them, that didn't stop Aaron from trying to make a joke of the situation by incorporating his moment of shame into a homecoming sign. Which was oddly sweet in a way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Now I think this kid is a trooper for doing this, he's basically telling this girl that he'd take a belt beating from his mom for the chance to hang out with his main squeeze. Sadly, her parents didn't see things the same way.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: twitter</a></figure><p>Oh well, there's always next year. Maybe he can capitalize on some of that viral fame and they'll be more open to their daughter going out with the young man. As embarrassing as it is, I have to give it to him for thinking to shut off the cameras in the house and being a 13-year-old who appeared to be a decent driver. Sure, it's illegal and it could've ended much uglier than it did, but his mom doesn't seem too broken up about it now.
