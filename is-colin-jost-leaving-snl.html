After all, the comedian has been serving as head writer of <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> since 2017 and has racked up five Writers Guild of America Awards during his tenure on the NBC sketch show.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily for SNL devotees, though, it sounds like Colin will be sticking around Studio 8H for a while longer…</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Colin Jost leaving ‘SNL’?</h2><p>Colin wrote that he’s “preparing mentally to leave SNL in the near future” in his new memoir, A Very Punchable Face.&nbsp;</p><p>“It just felt right as I was writing,” he later explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Washington Post</a>. “I think what I wanted to open up about was just that fear of leaving and the fear of letting go of something that has been so important in my life.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Will Heath/NBC</span></figure><p>“It’s scary thinking about leaving,” he added. “I guess, on some level, I needed to face that or think about it, and that’s how I ended up there. It wasn’t really with a specific date in mind or a timeline in mind. It really was the emotional process of thinking about it.”</p><p>But Colin downplayed his eventual SNL departure during an Oct. 15 appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don’t have a real timeline, I just meant like I started to potentially psychologically brace for the concept of leaving, which I hadn’t really done,” he told Ellen. "I don’t really know. Certainly, quarantine makes you appreciate having any job. And [I’m] very much appreciating having friends you get to work with and enjoy seeing."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Colin Jost married to Scarlett Johansson?</h2><p>Colin Jost and Scarlett Johansson got engaged in May 2019 — following two years of dating — but they’re not married yet. During his Ellen appearance, Colin jokingly blamed the delay on “Weekend Update” cohost Michael Che.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost</p></figure><p>“[Che] plans to make a scene at most events. That’s his general approach,” he said. “That’s part of why we’ve just been postponing it. … We can see him getting ready for the wedding, and we’re like, ‘Maybe we should wait another day.’”</p><p>He went on: “What I really want for Che is, I really want to ask him to do an objection at the wedding. A lot of people do speeches, but I think it would be nice in that moment, so few people utilize that moment to object and I think he could do a really great objection.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Along with 'SNL,' Colin was cast in the 'Tom and Jerry' movie!</h2><p>As if being the head writer at SNL and planning a wedding to a Hollywood actress isn't enough, Colin will also appear in the upcoming adaptation of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom and Jerry</a>, set to premiere in 2021.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Me Akiva Liz and Slamberg at Tivoli in Copenhagen during our first years at SNL when we used to all go on random trips together on off weeks.
