Read on for the full details — pun intended.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">OK, so what does "shake that Laffy Taffy" actually mean in the song?</h2><p>For everyone who wonders what "shake that Laffy Taffy" means in the song of the same name, Fabo told the story behind how the iconic song was born to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex</a> in 2016.</p><p>"We were doing a lot of crazy gangster music all the time. We were from a bad neighborhood," he said, setting the scene for how they came up with "Laffy Taffy."</p><p>Fabo explained, "We were in the strip club one night — we were at Babes, that's where it goes down — and we brought a couple of girls back to the studio, and I was just in the booth saying something like, 'Tootsie roll,' at first, and was like, 'Nah.' I had this piece of candy in my pocket and pulled it out and said, 'Girl, shake that Laffy Taffy.' And from there, we just perfected it. It was just that moment."</p><p>Indeed, according to Fabo, he always has candy on hand.</p><p>"Everybody who know me know I'm the candy man," he told Complex. "I always have some candy in my pocket. If you run into me and are like, 'Yo, give me some candy,' I guarantee I have some candy for you."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">"Laffy Taffy" wasn't a hit with D4L at first, even though fans loved it.</h2><p>Just because the song went on to be a big hit — and was born out of Fabo's obsession with candy — that doesn't mean he was feeling the lyrics at first or that he even enjoyed hearing the song.</p><p>"Actually I hated the song. I swear to God, I <a href=#>hated the song</a>," Fabo admitted to Complex, noting he wasn't the only one not into it. "I could remember Shawty Lo calling home from jail saying, 'Don't put that song out!'"</p><p>Eventually, Fabo grew to appreciate "Laffy Taffy," saying, "Actually being on the road performing it, it started getting real fun. I grew to love it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Laffy Taffy song came out 17 years ago… feel old yet?</p>— Dame (@PositiveThug) <a href=#>March 3, 2022</a></figure><p>Fans still love the tune, with one person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeting</a> in 2020, "'Laffy Taffy' my fav song of all time."</p><p>For others, the song is so iconic, it marks the passage of time in their lives.</p><p>The song is even having a moment on <a href=#>TikTok</a>, with users dancing to the chorus, and appropriately shaking their rear ends. And so, "Laffy Taffy" lives on almost two decades after it was conceived of in a recording booth, thanks to a piece of candy, and our culture's ongoing obsession with the booty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXai1orfEZquhmaRiuaKyxbJkrZmWm8ZuucSapWahnmLBqbGMrKannw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./66257-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>54 of 136 Girls From Latest Boko Haram Video Identified by Chibok Parents</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./resign-with-immediate-effect-blood-flowing-in-nigeria-gumi-tells-buhari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Resign With Immediate Effect; Blood Flowing In Nigeria Gumi Tells Buhari</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
