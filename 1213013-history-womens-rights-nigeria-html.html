She was a decent candidate but when the votes were calculated, only one person voted for her. Even those women who seemed to support her attempt and her program were afraid to vote for her and to show their faith in her in public.</p><p class=align-left>Another cruel tradition, which has ruined or even taken the lives of many women in Nigeria and other countries, was female genital mutilation. The official regulation against this cruel and dangerous practice was signed by Goodluck Jonathan as his last legislative action as President.

Still, it’s a country where women are not completely free yet, where little girls are being stolen by terrorist organizations and where a woman is supposed to obey and stay quiet. Nigeria is deeply patriarch and even though the Constitution forbids discrimination, the final word is always said by men while women follow them meekly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b72e7b031504658f.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: History of feminism in Nigeria</p><p class=align-left>Specifics of gender equality in Nigeria are visible when we come to the countryside and see that 60% of those who work in fields are females. Another issue is in the restricted access to education. 80% of women in Nigeria can’t write of read. The problem is especially characteristic for the northern part of the country. Terrorist organizations often treat women as rubbish. In 2014 only, Boko Haram stole nearly 300 of girls right from their school. The explanation was: the girls must leave the school and find husbands. Only 82 of those girls are free. A part of them is still missing and the rest are considered dead.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/de9f73d297420183.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Causes of early marriage in Africa</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e1ff40210b2b5f14.jpg><p class=align-left>Domestic violence is a huge problem. Of course, there is a law that forbids cruelty at home but in practice women remain unprotected because the police treats these situations as a personal matter of every separate family. As a result, women who have nowhere to go are forced to stay with their cruel husbands, are forced to put up with it, and sometimes this violence has very sad results.</p><p class=align-left>Today, representatives of younger generations feel much freer than their parents and they show much more respect to women and their rights. However, elder men are still very conservative and yet a lot is to be done to change their way of thinking at least a little.</p><h2>Reproductive rights of women in Nigeria</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bd1926eb12b7aabe.jpg><p class=align-left>It’s a usual thing that reproductive rights of women are violated along with their general rights.

For instance, abortions are actually illegal in any part of Nigeria and the only case when a woman can abort an unwanted pregnancy is if the pregnancy and delivery can put her own life at risk. In all other cases, she must have this child, no matter what.</p><p class=align-left>All this leads to the fact that women in Nigeria resort to unsafe abortions performed in many ways. There’s no need to say that such abortions are taking the lives of many women in all parts of the country. There have been many attempts of creating a movement for women’s rights. One of their goals was to provide contraceptives for women who had undergone sexual violence and could fall pregnant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/da67c7dc86cabe46.jpg><p class=align-left>Yet, all these efforts have not given any significant result, and even now a woman can terminate a pregnancy legally only in case her life is in danger. Together with the lack of access to normal effective and affordable contraceptives, unsafe abortions remain one of the most popular methods of birth control and family planning for many women in Nigeria.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt69rbeegfju6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the truth behind the age of consent in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It’s a pity that the most active fighters against women’s rights issues in Nigeria are also women and that they have to face a number of obstacles in their activities exactly due to the problems they want to solve. Hopefully, this vicious circle will be broken one day and women in Nigeria will enjoy their lives, love, and careers as they want.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: Nigerian heroes and their contributions</p><p class=align-left><strong>SOURCE</strong>: pambazuka.org</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnN9kmlobGWYnsC1u9GyZLCnnZq7tHnRop6hrKNiu6qzxKugmmaYqbqt</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./true-crime-podcasters-slammed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Insincere True Crime Influencers Get Slammed in Viral TikTok</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-trunk-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eddie Trunk - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
