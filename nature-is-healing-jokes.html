Some are tweeting not so earnestly, and it's really funny.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>With most people around the country on lockdown, there have been stories of water clearing up, air pollution lessening, and wildlife being spotted in the streets. People keep saying that without humans, "nature is healing." They're lamenting that "humans are the virus," when in fact, it's our policies and processes that need to change.&nbsp;</p><p>As quick as people were to say "natural wildlife has returned," others were there with the jokes. And they're pretty great.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. 'Cats' cats all over London</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The only thing scarier than the Cats movie would be if these nightmare creatures were real and roaming the streets of London right now. The bright side would be that it would definitely keep people from leaving their homes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Wild pizza pies</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Everyone knows that Italy is where pizzas used to roam free before people arrived, built cities, and started baking fake ones in brick ovens across the work. Now, the wild pizzas are back. And boy, are they gorgeous.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Minion mayhem</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If this happened, I would 100 percent take it as a sign of the coming apocalypse. I would not be able to handle it. That <a href=#>minion</a> has the look of the devil in its eyes. And you know it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Toilet bowl aquarium</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>There is a lot of fake "nature is healing" news out there, a lot of Photoshopped pranks and fake news, but this one is clearly real. Ocean creatures are returning to toilet bowls — their natural habitats —&nbsp;all over the world!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Big, dapper mice</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Wow. Not only have animals returned to nature, but they've gotten gigantic and learned how to make clothes! We as human beings must step back to let the mice grow to their full potential.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Zoo animals on the loose</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This looks like the stampede in the original Jumanji movie, so I think now is a good time to talk about how the remakes might be fun but will never hold a candle to the Robin Williams / Bonnie Hunt / Kirsten Dunst original.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Rubber ducky, in the Thames!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Rubber ducky, you're the one. You make rivers lots of fun. Rubber ducky, I'm awfully scared of you because wow, that's big. Is it just me or is this rubber duck serving some seriously terrifying Minion vibes?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Ducks are back</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Shh, shh. Don't scare them. They want to take that bread, but if you spook them, they might accidentally spit and clean your floor. I guess that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world, now that I think about it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. The King (Kong) of New York</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Could you even imagine if today, all of a sudden, newscasters had to come on TV and say, "Well, folks, in addition to sheltering in place due to the global pandemic, there is a giant gorilla on top of the Empire State Building, so, yeah, stay inside."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Subway boot bird</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Ah yes, the famed New York subway boot bird. They're very rare, much rarer than pigeons. And you have to be careful when you spot one. If you make any sudden movements, they'll do nothing because it's just an abandoned pair of boots.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Wild Volvos in the woods</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If you listen carefully at night, you can hear the wild hordes of Volvos revving their engines and beeping their horns at night. No one knows what they're doing out there because no one wants to risk getting run over in a Volvo stampede. What a way to go.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Floating sharks</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>OK, but real story: There are those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shark balloons</a> you can buy that have a little motor, so they float through the air like they're swimming, and one time, for my boss, I had to build one, inflate it, and then figure out to mail it in a giant box so when the recipient opened it up, it would swim out at them. It was the worst work task ever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Shopping cart out for a swim</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>So that's where the shopping carts escape to at night! This must explain why they're all sticky every time you touch one. It's the swamp algae.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Wet cake</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Truly, this is one of the saddest pictures I've ever seen. All that's running through my mind is that no one will be able to eat this perfectly delicious-looking cake. It looks expertly decorated too. What a tragedy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Teletubbies roam free</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>One more horrifying fact about this pandemic is that it has apparently unleashed a population of wild Teletubbies. No one wants this. No one needs this. Someone needs to grab a giant net and grab those revolting creatures.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Tidal Basin dolphins</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Newsflash: Dolphins don't populate reservoirs like the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. This is a pretty wonderful fake picture, though. I'd be cool if this is what the apocalypse actually looked like.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. Growing office walls</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I'm over here giggling about the idea that all office walls grow grass and weeds while we're not there. It doesn't take much to make me lose it laughing these days. Because if we're not laughing about vertical garden walls, we'd be crying about everything else, am I right?!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Dinosaurs roaming free</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I am trying to imagine a world in which the COVID-19 pandemic is still happening, but there's also a theme park full of real live dinosaurs that we have to keep from getting out. And I think I just came up with the plot to the next Jurassic World movie. Chris Pratt, call me.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19. Pigeon airport party</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>How much do you want to bet this pigeon is like, "Where are all the humans? Are they really gone! Hallelujah! It's party time!" and then he does the Tom Cruise slide from Risky Business? I'm pretty sure this is exactly how it went.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20. Lime scooters back where they belong</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>As sad as the cake photo made me, this photo is having the opposite effect. Every Lime scooter that exists should be set free. As in, drowned in the river, never to return. And that's how I feel about Lime scooters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo661wdGeZKKrXZ2yorjIp55mop%2BgsrQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./do-they-have-sex-on-joe-millionaire.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Do They Have Sex on 'Joe Millionaire'?
