Their lives took an abrupt turn after Jim was accused of rape, fraud, and conspiracy. Jim Bakker was later sentenced to time in prison while his wife and kids were left to bear the embarrassment of his crimes. Here's more info on Tammy Faye's children.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many kids did Tammy Faye Bakker have?</h2><p>Together, Tammy Faye and Jim Bakker shared two children — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Charles "Jay" Bakker</a>, and Tammy Sue Bakker. Tammy Faye went on to remarry Roe Messner in 1993, but the two did not have any children together.</p><p>Jay struggled with substance abuse after his father’s arrest and subsequent ostracization from the church, but he later became a co-founder of the Revolution church, which now has several campuses across the U.S.</p><p>In the past, Jay, who claims to have had a “really strange life,” has been candid about his traumatic upbringing, which is depicted in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. According to Jay, he believed that his mother was much different from the person the media made her out to be. “She was very aware [of their criticism], but she always loved people. Even when they were mean, she loved them,” Tammy’s son told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by ⚡️Jay Bakker⚡️ (@jaybakker)</a></p></figure><p>While Jay seems to have followed in his father’s footsteps (at least as far as his career is concerned), the couple's daughter, Tammy Sue, has stayed out of the spotlight for the last 17 years. In a candid interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TODAY</a>, Tammy Faye’s daughter opened up about what she misses most about her mother more than a decade after the latter's death, including the songs she would sing to Tammy Sue as a child.</p><p>“I loved hearing that voice. It was almost like this 1940s gorgeous thing that she would do, and I would beg her, 'Please record that.' Sadly, she never did. There's just so many wonderful things that I wish the world could know about her,” Tammy Sue said of her late mother.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tammy Faye Bakker’s final interview was shot days before her death.</h2><p>Tammy Faye was well-known for her gaudy jewelry and eccentric makeup, but she looked much different during her appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry King Live</a> on July 18, 2017. Many were aware that Tammy Faye had been diagnosed with colon cancer in 1996, but the severity of her illness was made clear during her interview.</p><p>In her final chat with Larry King, Tammy remained adamant about her faith in God and insisted that the gates of heaven would be waiting on her when she arrived.</p><p>The Eyes of Tammy Faye premiered in theaters on Sept. 17, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqa6uudhmnZqxlWKvorfKnqlmm5ieuaW%2BxKc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./288747-uhuru-ruto-wahofishwa-na-mahubiri-ya-mchungaji-wakati-wa-mazishi-ya-kamaru-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Uhuru, Ruto wahofishwa na mahubiri ya mchungaji wakati wa mazishi ya Kamaru</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./no-allocation-to-my-office-for-six-months-over-tension-with-obaseki-shaibu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>No Allocation To My Office For Six Months Over Tension With Obaseki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
