Probably a raccoon...fortunately she managed to escape with her life and a giant deep gash. Doctor said she was tough as nails as he put her back together today."</p><p>Fans immediately sent well wishes to the father-of-four. "Awwwww so so sorry Matt hope she heals fast," one follower wrote, while another added, "Poor lil baby, you have to keep an eye out always she’s a little tiny baby, get well soon!"</p><p>The motivational speaker first introduced viewers to his Chihuahua Maltese Poodle mix in August 2015. He adopted the pup — whose full name is Lucy Bella — through the organization <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oregon Friends of Shelter Animals</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you Matt for giving Lucy Bella a fabulous new home to grow up on and for your continued support of OFOSA and our mission to save shelter animals," the foster-based rescue wrote in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a> at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>For those wondering how Lucy is doing today, it appears she's made a full recovery.

Despite her small size, little Lucy continues to be the fastest critter on the farm!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Matt previously shared that he was inspired to write the book while recovering from major spinal surgery in 2016. "With time on his hands and after a great deal of personal reflection, Matt was reminded of his own childhood spent in hospitals and how important faith, encouragement, positivity, and hope was to him at that time," a description on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> reads.</p><p>We’re happy to see that Matt’s "co-pilot" is doing well and bringing joy to kids all over the country.
