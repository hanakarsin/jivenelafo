If you’ve ever wondered about the possibilities of moving in with your besties for life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Bedrooms</a> may have some of the answers you’re looking for. Streaming on <a href=#>NBC’s new platform Peacock</a>, this eight-episode drama about home ownership and friendship is a delightful examination of chosen families and unconventional house-sharing arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p>Audiences are already abuzz about the show’s Australian stars, who all bring a great chemistry to the ensemble cast. But in particular, the character of Harry has caught the eye of American fans who want to know more about actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roy Joseph</a>. So if you’re curious about Roy, keep scrolling to find out everything you need to know about this hunk from down undah.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sarah Enticknap/Peacock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'Five Bedrooms' star Roy Joseph is your new Australian crush.</h2><p>Roy Joseph plays Harry on Five Bedrooms, a successful plastic surgeon who’s gay (not really a spoiler since we find this out in Episode 1) but too afraid to tell his mum (that's Australian spelling for you!), who he still lives with. While audiences have really connected with Harry’s journey to find himself and his voice, they also have latched on to one of the show’s unconventional romances, the one between Harry and his best friend Liz (Kat Stewart).</p><p>Roy has said that he was drawn to the show’s unconventional relationships and depictions of people with varying backgrounds coming together to make a community work. The actor himself was born in Israel but moved to Perth when he was six months old with his mother and father, who are Iraqi and Indian. Roy’s parents are also both Jewish which led to a rather unconventional upbringing with Middle Eastern, Indian, Jewish, and Australian traditions all melded together in the Joseph household.</p><p>While Roy wanted to be an actor from a young age, he didn’t have the confidence to pursue his dreams for a long time, and as a fallback, completed an entertainment management course with the aim of ending up on the behind-the-scenes side of the music industry. But thankfully for viewers everywhere, Roy eventually found his way to the small screen with his breakthrough role as Vijay Kapoor in the Australian comedy Back in Very Small Business.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Roy Joseph (@joe_smoooth)</a> on Jul 13, 2020 at 11:27pm PDT</p></figure><p>It was the casting director from his first gig as Vijay Kapoor who recommended Roy to Five Bedrooms creators Michael Lucas and Christine Bartlett, who then not only hired him for the role of Harry, but also re-wrote the character’s age to 30 so it would be more believable for 26-year-old Roy to play the part.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Roy Joseph dating anyone?</h2><p>Since he’s quite new to the acting scene with only a handful of projects under his belt, there’s relatively little information about Roy's relationships online.&nbsp;</p><p>But a scroll through his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> shows someone who, like his character Harry, has chosen to surround himself with a lot of beautiful friends. It seems safe to say, however, that if he's currently single, the six-foot Australian will have no trouble snagging someone soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Five Bedrooms premieres August 13 on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKunqWK3sL%2FEqZ9mnpmrsm6uxJ2pqKedqA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./date-multiple-men-if-you-want-to-secure-the-ring-tacha-advises-single-ladies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Date Multiple Men If You Want To Secure The Ring</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nicola-coughlan-dating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nicola Coughlan's Dating History: Bridgerton Star's Love Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
