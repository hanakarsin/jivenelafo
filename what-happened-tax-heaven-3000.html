The listing is no longer available, and the title is not listed on the developer's page.</p><p>It's been theorized that the title was taken down for security reasons. Since Tax Heaven 3000 promised to prepare your federal tax return for you, players would be required to input their social security numbers.</p><p>"Lol, looks like Tax Heaven 3000 got removed from Steam for the time being because Steam thinks it's a scam lol," one Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, attaching a screenshot with a comment from the developer.</p><p>"STEAM IS DEPLATFORMING TH3K.
