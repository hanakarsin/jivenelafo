I remember when my parents yelled at me for putting up a picture in a bikini on <a href=#>Myspace</a>, but now, parents have even more to worry about than pervy people online who want to look at young strangers. Now, they have to worry about people actually finding them and their children.</p><p>Yes, a man on <a href=#>TikTok</a> who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jose Monkey</a> has shown parents, kids, and the rest of us how he can find anyone using some simple coding and geolocation. In doing so, he successfully scares (and teaches) us all about <a href=#>how dangerous the internet can be</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@the_josemonkey</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jose Monkey makes TikTok videos to show how he can find anyone using geolocation.</h2><p>Jose is a pretty smart guy; luckily, he‚Äôs using his talent for good. But not everyone with his skills would necessarily use them as an educational tool. Some might be more nefarious. And although Jose‚Äôs goal is to teach people about internet safety, he‚Äôs also teaching people how to use his geolocation knowledge in the process.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@the_josemonkey href=#>@the_josemonkey</a><p>Replying to @Ginnaffer Listen to your mom! üòú <a title=geolocation href=#>#geolocation</a> <a title=osint href=#>#OSINT</a> <a title=onlinesafety href=#>#onlinesafety</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - josemonkey" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - josemonkey</a></figure><p>If someone with bad intentions knows how to code with frontend javascript, then they‚Äôll be able to use Jose‚Äôs methods, which he shares with everyone, to find anyone they want to find. But let‚Äôs talk about the good that Jose is doing before we get into the less good.</p><p>Basically, Jose‚Äôs tagline is that he ‚Äúfinds people who want to be found.‚Äù Anyone over the age of 18 who tags Jose and asks him to find them has the opportunity to be found. What this means is that if someone posts a random video in a random place, Jose will use his skills to figure out where in the world they are.</p><p>He has some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very specific rules</a> to make sure he‚Äôs only finding people who want to be found, such as that they must tag him and must show their face speaking so that he knows it‚Äôs not a voiceover. He even has printouts that people can hold that say, ‚ÄúFind me!‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@the_josemonkey href=#>@the_josemonkey</a><p>Just a quick update to my FAQ video for the new folks</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - josemonkey" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - josemonkey</a></figure><p>Typically, someone such as a parent, or just anyone, will ask Jose to find them. They either want to test him or to prove a point to someone they know that anyone can find anyone with very little information. These people tend to record selfie videos in nondescript locations and in doing so, they challenge Jose to find their location with no other information.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one video</a>, a mother asks Jose to find her. He‚Äôs able to pinpoint her exact location in Winder, Ga., using the landmarks, shops, and shadows. He figures out which way she‚Äôs facing and the direction of the roads behind her. He finds a water tower, a small shed, a CVS, and a Wendy‚Äôs. With just that information, Jose is able to create a map of what he expects her area looks like.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@the_josemonkey</a></figure><p>After doing that, he feeds the data into a javascript code that uses Google‚Äôs map database, and he pinpoints about 10 locations that match the description. From there, he uses Google Maps street view to narrow down where the woman is. It‚Äôs time-consuming work, but he proves that with the right set of skills and determination, anyone can find anyone based on their videos.</p><p>As of July 2023, he‚Äôs found over 100 different people‚Äôs locations. And now, the more popular he gets, the more people there are who ask Jose to find them, which means he has plenty more locations to go.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">People must request to be found by Jose Monkey ... although not all geolocation wizards are as respectful.</h2><p>Why are people so into being found? Perhaps it comes down to just wanting to challenge Jose. Or, as people often comment, they want to teach and protect the people they love from using the internet unsafely. But there‚Äôs likely also a main-character syndrome aspect to wanting to be found.</p><p>We all know about main character energy, and while it‚Äôs looked at as a negative thing, we should think of ourselves as the main characters in our stories! However, we are not the center of the universe. But when Jose finds us, it gives us a sense of existing in this vast world. And for one moment, we might feel like the center, even if we‚Äôre not. Some people might need that feeling and benefit from it. But it could do more harm than good for those who fall on the narcissism spectrum.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@the_josemonkey href=#>@the_josemonkey</a><p>Geolocation Lightning Round! <a title=geolocation href=#>#geolocation</a> <a title=osint href=#>#OSINT</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - josemonkey" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - josemonkey</a></figure><p>Even still, Jose is doing important work by making people, especially young people, aware of how much information is readily available. And although he talks us through how he finds each of the requests, he doesn‚Äôt actually dive into the coding of it all, so unless an ill-intentioned person has vast coding knowledge, Jose‚Äôs skills aren‚Äôt very transferrable.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>One of the best things Jose can do aside from finding people who ask to be found is that he can figure out where different movies and television series are filmed. So there are other uses for Jose‚Äôs geolocation skills besides creepily teaching us all a very important lesson!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vedSsnKxll5q8rbvCmquip55iwbB5xaKlnWWRo8awusQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fifamanny-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Manny Brown - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./masked-singer-season-3-winner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>'The Masked Singer' Season 3 Winner Is ...</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
