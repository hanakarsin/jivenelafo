So even if you own it you don't really own it.</p><p>Then there are all the headaches of owning a home, maintaining a property, footing the bill for all repairs, insurance, higher heating and energy costs, it can all seem not worth the headache. So renting seems like an alluring option. That is, until you get a crappy landlord.
