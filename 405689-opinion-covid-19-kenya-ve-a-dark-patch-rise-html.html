But things changed fast and the first cases of the coronavirus were reported in Egypt and Algeria in February 2020, causing a wave of panic across Africa.</p><p class=align-left>As the virus continued to spread across the continent, our worst fears of having the virus within our boundaries were confirmed on Friday, March 13, 2020, when Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe announced that <a href=#>the first Kenyan, a 27-year-old African</a> had contracted the virus.

They were scared of their children’s welfare at school and journey back home and confused about what the future held. The youths in higher learning institutions as well as those employed or jobless stared at uncertain days.</p><p class=align-left>A cloud of uncertainty hung low over every head, bearing in mind that very little was known about this virus.</p><p class=align-left>Even the <a href=#>Western</a> countries perceived to be superior were recording high infection rates and subsequent deaths.</p><p class=align-left>went missing from public spaces as they hardly had answers to questions raised by their voters, including one about that questionable flight from Asia that was largely suspected to have contributed to the importation of the virus.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b067f44c41a29823.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Reggie Warren: Member of famous R&B group Troop dies at age 52</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nobody had a better understanding of the disease that was felling people in Italy, shaking the US and the UK, pricking Russia and whirling in South Africa.</p><p class=align-left>While I reeled under the weight of fear on Sunday, March 15, 2020, I, in hindsight, now feel I was lucky to have been spared the apocalyptic visions some people, including scientists, endured.</p><p class=align-left>Strolling in my Eastlands backyard that evening, shortly after Uhuru announced the first containment protocols orders, I could see faces spelling the word fear in capital letters. The hood is usually full of life.</p><p class=align-left>Some people were gathered in small groups talking in low tones and would intermittently widen the spaces between them as they came to terms with the term social distancing.</p><p class=align-left>The local supermarkets were flooded with locals scrambling for dry foods and handwashing soaps whose prices had shot up.</p><p class=align-left>Cereals’ traders enjoyed booming business but were not excited as they never knew what tomorrow would bring.

Adapting to remote working came with its fair share of challenges, lessons, and good times, in different measure. It was weird right? There were frantic efforts to adapt to what continues to be the new normal one year later.</p><p class=align-left>Relatives upcountry called regularly, asking how the city was; they were scared for us and we acted strong but the fear within was obvious. The city was the epicentre of the ‘foreign’ virus. Mbagathi Hospital became a household, but dreaded name.</p><p class=align-left>We learnt to spell, pronounce and live the words, quarantine, isolation etc. The then newly appointed Kagwe was revered - his speeches penetrated many ears than religious sermons.</p><p class=align-left>His words of hope inspired scared Kenyans more than Obama’s ‘Yes We Can’ slogan did in 2008.</p><p class=align-left>Afya House doors looked like an entrance to a place called hope. Who didn’t have panic attacks and imaginary symptoms of <a href=#>COVID-19</a>? You experienced one symptom and your mind added imaginary ones and somehow you just felt unwell.
