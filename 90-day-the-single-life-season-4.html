Fans already want more drama from some of the same cast members from Season 3, so are there any updates yet?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>We still aren't through the entire Season 3 tell-all for <a href=#>90 Day: The Single Life</a>, being that the first part dropped on Nov. 28 on the Discovery Plus app ahead of its television premiere. But that hasn't stopped viewers from wondering if there will be a 90 Day: The Single Life Season 4. And if there's another season, how soon could we get it?</p><p>Don't get us wrong — we fully appreciate a good <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé</a> tell-all that reveals information that cast members were just dodgy enough to keep off social media. But it's hard not to also get pumped for an entirely new season that may feature some of the same cast members, along with some others sprinkled in there for a fresh mess or two.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Caesar searches for love in Season 3 of '90 Day: The Single Life.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When is Season 4 of '90 Day: The Single Life'?</h2><p>Although TLC hasn't yet announced if 90 Day: The Single Life was renewed or when the fourth season would premiere, it's all but certain that we'll see more iterations of the 90 Day Fiancé spinoff. The network seems to rely heavily on shows in the franchise and there's a high possibility that there will be a Season 4 of 90 Day: The Single Life at some point.</p><p>And a fan on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> shared a photo in October 2022 that shows Natalie allegedly filming a new season. If it's legitimate, then it means the fourth season is not only on its way, but that filming has begun too.</p><p>And, going by previous seasons, it could be here sooner rather than later. The first season premiered in February 2021 and ended in May 2021. Later that same year, in November, Season 2 premiered. It ended in May 2022 and Season 3 premiered in September 2022. If we have to wait around five or six months for Season 4, that means it could premiere on TLC in May or June 2023.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span><p>Debbie and Tony hit it off during Season 3 of '90 Day: The Single Life.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The '90 Day: The Single Life' cast for Season 4 could include some Season 3 stars.</h2><p>Although there aren't any details out there yet about Season 4 of 90 Day: The Single Life, there is some speculation on which cast members may return. Like Natalie, who still hasn't made a definitive decision between new boyfriend Josh and her husband Mike, who she still hasn't divorced yet. If producers ask her to return, it's hard to imagine she would turn down the opportunity.</p><p>Debbie's story might also be far from finished. We see her move to Canada at the end of Season 3 to live with her new boyfriend. But her son, Colt, still highly disapproves of the relationship.</p><p>If we're lucky, there could also be some familiar faces from other shows in the franchise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Natalie is keeping the lights on at 90 Day "The Single Life"!

Now that Kolini is on Pillow Talk for 90 Day: The Single Life, fans have responded positively to her and she could be a potential main cast member in the future.</p><p>The good thing, however, is that no matter who is in Season 4, it's going to be someone who was either always single in the franchise or who is newly single and ready to find love on reality TV again.</p><p>Watch 90 Day: The Single Life on Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfbn1usMCyZK2glWLAqrrGpZxmpJmbsm6%2FxJqqqKZdaQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./noah-schnapp-controversy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What He Said About Israel-Hamas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./government-revenue-trapped-in-commercial-banks-rmfac-chair.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Government Revenue Trapped In Commercial Banks RMFAC Chair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
