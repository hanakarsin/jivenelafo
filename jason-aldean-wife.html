Known for songs like “Big Green Tractor,” “Take a Little Ride,” and “My Kinda Party,” he has made a name for himself in the industry. Based on his music and lyrics, he displays a persona of a “down home” simple man who just wants to live in the country with his woman and his truck. However, from the looks of his wife’s social media profiles, the couple and their children live anything but a simple country life.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason’s <a href=#>wife</a>, Brittany, has garnered herself quite a following on social media, showing her life with her kids as well as fashion tips and sponsored posts. Jason and Brittany made headlines after Brittany made some comments about the Capitol insurrection that were considered controversial. However, this is not the couple’s first time dealing with public backlash.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittany took to her Instagram to post some controversial claims.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Brittany Aldean</u></a> shared her thoughts about the January 2021 Capitol raid on her Instagram which included a repost of an image claiming that two men in the group of Trump supporters were actually supporters of antifa, a political protest movement affiliated with the takedown of fascism and extreme right-wing movements.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The image’s claims have been deemed "baseless" by the </u><u>Associated Press</u></a>. “There’s no credible evidence to date that rioters who breached the Capitol in an effort to stop certification of U.S. presidential election results were supporters of antifa…,” the outlet reported. “Steven D’Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, told reporters...there’s “no indication” at this time that antifa activists were disguised as Trump supporters in [the] riot.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brittany Aldean (@brittanyaldean)</a></p></figure><p>After Mrs. Aldean posted the image, Instagram shortly removed the image. In response, Brittany Aldean posted a video. "It’s getting so ridiculous the filters you put on everyone that’s against your narrative," she said.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jason and Brittany’s relationship started on a controversial note.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, Brittany met Jason in 2012. During that time, he was married to his then-wife, Jessica Ussery, who had been married since 2001. The couple has two daughters together. In 2012, Jason was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>photographed getting close with Brittany</u></a> at a bar, and the two ended up in the tabloids. Jason and Brittany both publicly apologized for their behavior after being met with much criticism.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brittany Aldean (@brittanyaldean)</a></p></figure><p>A year later, Jason and his wife separated. Not long after the divorce filing, Jason and Brittany made their new relationship public. The two got engaged in September 2014 and married in March 2015. “The couple seemed happy together, but many fans were disturbed by the controversial way that they first met, and the questionable circumstances under which they established their romance,” Cheat Sheet reported.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brittany was a contestant on ‘American Idol.’</h2><p>After studying Human Environmental Science in college, Brittany decided to take up a job modeling. In 2010, she entered a model search for Victoria’s Secret. She did not get a spot as a model.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>While pursuing her modeling career, she also worked as a professional cheerleader and makeup artist. In 2012, she appeared as a contestant on Season 11 of American Idol. However, her luck ran out again and she didn’t make it past the “Hollywood” phase of the competition. The judges commented on her good looks and tenacity, but she did not end up going far in the competition.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mmKWclZa7bsPIn5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dean-ambrose-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Moxley - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./381107-mp3million-download-buy-cheap-hd-mp3-music-online-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>MP3Million: Download &amp;amp; buy cheap HD MP3 music online</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
