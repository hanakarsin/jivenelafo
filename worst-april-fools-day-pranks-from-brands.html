Some of these are just unfunny, while others had negative repercussions.

We don't quite get the joke ‚Äî especially considering the need for more eco-friendly transportation methods with the ongoing global climate crisis.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eh-Oh...what could the Teletubbies be possibly hiding from us?

Token" for the pranking holiday. Both Teletubbies and cryptocurrencies are scary enough on their own, but add to that the imagery the brand released leading up to the announcement, and it's downright terrifying.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Scary how many of you actually wanted to try these yesterday <a href=#>#AprilFools</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/TyQKiVrrEP</a></p>‚Äî Bud Light (@budlight) <a href=#>April 1, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bud Light's Pizza Seltzer.</h2><p>There's nothing wrong with new hard-seltzer flavors (even if the market might be a little oversaturated with them right now), but a pizza-flavored one sounds downright disgusting. This prank wasn't even a bad call on the brand, which knew it would be a horrifying combo, but more so on those in the replies who admitted they wanted to try it. No, thank you.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Durex</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Durex's 2019 Hot Pot condoms.</h2><p>The "Fish Skin Condom with Mala Hot Pot flavor" was part of the brand's 2019 April Fool's Prank, which was advertised to be made with "real, fragrant mala oil." Do we really need to explain why this is just a horrifying combination to even consider?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Gmail's 2016 "Mic Drop" prank.</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to have the final word on an unnecessarily long email chain, ending the needless back-and-forth (and thus, winning the discussion)? Well, in 2016, Google offered an option for users to do just that with their "Mic Drop" button.</p><p>Users who clicked the button would send the email recipient a gif of Bob the Minion from Despicable Me before archiving the thread.&nbsp;</p><p>This feature, unfortunately, was used on accident by many, and cost some their jobs.
