It didn't take long before some of the co-stars began linking up romantically, and rumors have been swirling that <a href=#>Brody Jenner</a> and <a href=#>Audrina Patridge</a> are together. But are the pair really dating? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Brody and Audrina together?</h2><p>Audrina and Brody link early on in Season 2 of New Beginnings, with Audrina admitting she spent the night with Brody (though she offered no other details on what that means for their relationship).</p><p>"Brody and I have known each other for a very long time," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. "I can't give up too much of what happened. There was a kiss, and we will talk about our friendship and where it led and what we decided on. But that is all on the show."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Brody Jenner and Audrina Patridge in 2010</p></figure><p>Audrina and Brody have known each other for years, but they've never dated — until now.</p><p>"He was a good kisser," she continued. "I feel like we have always had a flirty relationship or friendship, whatever it was. And I think at this point, we were both single and we grew up a lot. We were in different places and it comes down to timing."</p><p>Brody was just as mum about the state of their relationship, telling fans they'll have to watch the show to see it all unfold.</p><p>“Audrina is a great kisser,” Brody also said. “We’ve always had chemistry, even in the original show, and she’s just so much fun to be around. For some reason, her and I are always the ones staying up the latest, talking too late … We’re really, really close.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Hills: New Beginnings (@mtvthehillsnewbeginnings)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There will reportedly be a love triangle this season involving the couple.</h2><p>It's unclear exactly where the couple stands today, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a> revealed that Brody and Audrina will be involved in a sticky love triangle this season.</p><p>While Brody and Audrina linked up early on in Season 2, Brody's ex, Kristin, comes back to LA to reunite with all of her old friends. But this clearly doesn't go over well with everyone.</p><p>For those who didn't watch The Hills when it first aired, Brody and Kristin were a power couple on the show. They met in 2004 and dated on and off for a couple of years before splitting in 2006. Kristin eventually married Jay Cutler, but they divorced in 2020.</p><p>"Kristin and Brody lived together, I didn't think they would ever split," <a href=#>Spencer Pratt</a> told The Sun.</p><p>It seems the pair split because of infidelity on Kristin's part, but can they reconcile all of these years later?</p><p>"If she didn't, this is breaking news, sorry Kristin, but if she didn't cheat on Brody back in the day, she did drink a little too much. So it's not an excuse," Spencer continued. "So if she didn't cheat on Brody, I don't know if they would ever [have] broken up, there may not have been a Jay Cutler, let's just say that."</p><p>Watch all of the drama unfold on The Hills: New Beginnings when it airs on Wednesdays on MTV at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecGrpp2xXZa7pXnArpuroZ6WeqWt06KloA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./415283-mejja-infuriated-tabia-za-wakenya-is-pulled-down-youtube-im-done-being-humble-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mejja Infuriated after Tabia Za Wakenya Is Pulled Down from YouTube: Im Done Being Humble&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-iwobi-insists-everton-wont-be-relegated-under-his-watch.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Iwobi Insists Everton Won't Be Relegated Under His Watch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
