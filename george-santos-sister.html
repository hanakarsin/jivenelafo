Tiffany's lease was terminated in May of 2022, five months after New York City lifted its pandemic-era eviction moratorium.</p><p>According to a court filing, Tiffany and two others have been squatting in the apartment since their lease was terminated.</p><p>“Respondent failed to pay the arrears sought in this proceeding, even after ERAP payment,” the court filing said. Tiffany apparently received roughly $30,000 in rental assistance from the federal government, but that money was not enough to pay off her debt.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>George Santos is a lot of things, but mainly he's just a liar. <a href=#>#Colbert</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LzuN69fMNR</a></p>— The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) <a href=#>January 4, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tiffany Santos was donating to her brother's campaign.</h2><p>Even as she was failing to pay the rent that she owed on the apartment, Tiffany donated to her brother's campaign as well as to several others. She donated $5,000 to her brother in December of 2021 and made $16,000 in additional donations to other GOP candidates, including Michelle Bond, who lost a GOP primary and returned some of Tiffany's money because she donated above the legal amount.</p><p>According to reporting by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Post</a>, Victor Alameida was once engaged to Tiffany and said that they had settled their debt with the landlord before leaving the building. Victor also said that he still lives in the building and that the building's managers accused him and Tiffany of doing things like pulling out the smoke detectors so that they could smoke in their apartment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Drawing on his experience negotiating the Treaty of Versailles, the end of Apartheid, and the Will Smith vs. Chris Rock debacle, freshman GOP congressman George Santos vows to help end the current House Speaker impasse.</p>— New York Times Pitchbot (@DougJBalloon) <a href=#>January 6, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are George Santos's parents?</h2><p>While Santos's sister has not come up much in his frequent lies about his history, his parents have been the subject of some of his most brazen untruths.</p><p>Santos claimed that his mother, Fatima Devolder, was "the first female executive at a major financial institution," and additionally claimed she had died as a result of 9/11.</p><p>Neither of these things was true. Devolder worked as a domestic worker, a cook, and a nurse, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Beast</a>, and she died on Dec. 23, 2016, more than 15 years after 9/11.</p><p>Less is known about Santos's father. Although he has claimed that his father is African American, there is no evidence of that.</p><p>Santos clearly believed he could tell these kinds of lies with impunity, and now he's been caught in a whole lot of them. His family has been caught up in all of this as well, and their own personal struggles have become subject to public scrutiny as a result of his actions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLKwvsaeZKyZnqm8tHnSoqqtnaI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kaelyn-petras-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kaelyn Petras - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alexandra-jarvis-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alexandra Jarvis - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
