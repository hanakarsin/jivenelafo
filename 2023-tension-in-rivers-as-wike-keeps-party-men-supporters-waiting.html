indecisiveness of the Rivers State Governor, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nyesom Wike</strong></a> to declare his position ahead of the 2023 general elections has stirred a tense atmosphere in the political space of the state.</h2><p>Supporters and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State in the camp of Governor Wike are yet to know the presidential candidate to support in 2023.</p><p>As Governor Wike is yet to state his position, his supporters don’t know if they should vote for PDP’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar or any other presidential candidate.</p><p>Rivers State in the last few months has attracted attention following Governor Wike’s call that the National Chairman of PDP, Iyorchia Ayu should resign.</p><p>Wike had asked that a southerner should take over for equity and fairness in PDP ahead of the 2023 race.</p><p>Although Governor Wike has assured stakeholders in PDP that he would not dump the party, his comments recently cast doubts on the promise.</p><p>Recall that Governor Wike during the inauguration of Rivers PDP campaign council said people who disrespected the state does not deserve the vote of Rivers people.</p><p>Wike claimed that Atiku picked people from Rivers State as members of the Presidential Campaign Council without consulting him.</p><p>He further stated that the decision of Atiku shows that he does not want his support in 2023.</p><p>Governor Wike recently also endorse the Lagos State Governor and Governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Babajide Sanwo-Olu against the PDP governorship candidate in the state.</p><p>Also with President Muhammadu Buhari’s award to Wike for his infrastructural renaissance witnessed in the Rivers, some political analysts in the state are wondering about the sudden romance by Governor Wike who had remained a strong critic of the APC government.</p><p>The development has seen the Rivers State chapter of APC warn Southwest Governors of the party to stop disrespecting them by romancing Wike.</p><p>The state stakeholders of the party gave the warning at a day consultative meeting with stalwarts of the party in the South-south zone in Port Harcourt.</p><p>The stakeholders called on the national leadership to prevail on the governors visiting the state if it is not for solidarity reasons.</p><p>The party also urged its national leadership to prevail on the governors to desist from coming to the state, if not for the sake of solidarity.</p><p>With the recent developments, it is difficult to point out the presidential candidate the Rivers PDP will cast their votes for in the 2023 election.</p><p class=postsid
