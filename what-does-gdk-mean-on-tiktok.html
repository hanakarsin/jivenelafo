Unfortunately, too often, those who partake in certain trends don’t know it can mean something entirely different to someone else.</p><p>Many TikTok users have begun using a hand symbol in their content. On the surface, the hand symbol looks like a half-heart. But users have confirmed the symbol means someone is GDK, an insult known by many familiar with OGs.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>So, what does GDK stand for?

After realizing many users were using a half heart as a trend to discuss things they don’t like, such as “people who rarely hit u up to hang out” or “girls who are 5’5,” TikTok user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay (@jaygobrazzyy)</a>, highlighted the fact that the symbol looks eerily similar to GDK.</p><p>“That s--t looks just like GDK,” Jay shared on camera. “You can’t say it doesn’t.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The GDK symbol is associated with the phrase "Gangster Disciple Killer." While the GDK symbol looks like a half-heart, it's really a pitchfork, a sign associated with the Gangster Disciples. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Department of Justice</a>, Gangster Disciples began in 1974 and, as of 2023, has nearly 3,000 members in Chicago and has a history of being "one of the most powerful and dangerous gangs in the Nation."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Those who don't respect or have beef with Gangster Disciples, also known as GDs, use the GDK symbol and say it to confirm they kill GDs. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Urban Dictionary</a>, anyone who doesn't agree or wants to kill GDs can rep GDK, though the symbol has been most widely used by members of GDs' rival gang, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Disciples</a>.</p><p>As TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hood University (@quanodag) </a>explained in his April 2023 TikTok, saying or doing the GDK or BDK symbols means you're against either respective gang. Another term, Everybody Killer (EBK), means you have beef and/or could kill anyone who steps in your way.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Celebrities have said or used GDK publicly.</h2><p>While those who used the GDK symbol on TikTok likely had no idea how sinister the gang sign could be, rumors have swirled that some celebrities know exactly which hood they’re repping.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>GDK became popular in the hip-hop community, particularly in drill and trap music. Several rappers like <a href=#>21 Savage</a>, the late <a href=#>Pop Smoke</a>, and Fivio Foreign have referenced GDK in their songs. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HipHop DX</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fivio Foreign</a> reportedly confirmed he was associated with the gang in his lyrics, stating, “You say you ain’t GDK / What the f--k is you doin’ with me?”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=#>King Combs</a>, son of <a href=#>Sean “Diddy” Combs</a>, also gave signs that he is against GDs after he used the GDK symbol publicly. In December 2023, a video obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">No Jumper</a> showed King throwing up the sign and saying “GDK” on camera as his girlfriend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven Tracy</a> grabbed his face.</p><p>King’s video received backlash from people like Chicago rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">King Yella</a>. King Yella responded to King Combs’ GDK sign by stating, “Why would you even try and involve yourself in a GDK movement? You were born rich and famous. What are you doing?”Amid the backlash, King Combs apologized and confirmed he’s not in a gang on his Instagram Stories.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“I ain’t affiliated with no gangs and I'm not a gang member!!” he wrote.</p><p>Much like King Combs, those using GDK, be it intentionally or unintentionally, should be mindful of what they’re doing, since the symbol can have dangerous consequences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXZyxrHnMnpinZZ%2BjerW1yq2mpA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-trinidad-james-face.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Trinidad James's Face?
