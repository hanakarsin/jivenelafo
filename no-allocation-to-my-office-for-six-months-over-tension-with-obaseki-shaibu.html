Sanni Abacha.</p><p>Shaibu further stated that Edo is top of his agenda to strengthen institutions in the state and he has sacrificed everything to make sure that Edo works.</p><p>He said, “You know there is tension between the governor and I. And for six months, there has been no allocation to my office. So, whatever I am doing is contributions from friends and my goodwill; and I am still standing very strong.</p><p>“I am your ambassador anywhere I am. This is not because of politics, but because of what you have done to save my life in the cause of doing your work.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have been deputy governor today if I am not alive. A journalist who did an investigation and wrote a report saved my life in the hands of the military.</p><p>“So, you can see the reason why I come anytime you invite me, even if it is difficult, I must show up because that is the only way I can appreciate and encourage you.</p><p>“I am also determined to make sure that in all things, Edo must be first and I am determined to strengthen institutions. I came into politics because I felt that we should have an egalitarian society. I came into politics to make institutions strong because that is the only way you can have the society of your dreams.</p><p>“When institutions are strong, you are able to deal with those guys that thinks they are powerful, moderate their excesses, and also promote and help the weak in the society.</p><p>“Institution does not know the rich, strong or the poor, it takes care of all strata of life. That is what I stand for, that is why I joined politics.</p><p>“That is why I have sacrificed a lot of things to make sure that Edo works. I even sacrificed my personal entitlement to make sure this institution works and in the coming weeks, I will give a stewardship of what I have done as deputy governor from 2016 to date.</p><p>“Very soon, there is going to be a world press conference to give my stewardship as deputy governor. And by the time I am done, Edo would have seen the level of sacrifice that some of us have made as deputy governor of Edo State.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5ByZqenXZa5rbvCmquip55iwbB5zLJkqJ6WnrCmecWoqWarma16rrvNrZ%2BsZZ%2BrsrN5056lrKGfo3q4tdOhZKiakaiyrLWMrJ%2BaoZKqfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tammy-faye-bakker-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tammy Faye Messner and Jim Bakker's Kids Open up About Their Traumatic Childhood</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lance-alexander-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lance Alexander - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
