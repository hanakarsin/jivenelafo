He said some Yoruba leaders, in particular, questioned his action for promoting the Igbo presidency rather than Tinubu, a Yoruba man.</p><p>Adebanjo said it took him time to explain to those criticizing him that the presidency is not a contest between the Yorubas and the Igbos.</p><p>“But ever since, social media has been filled with comments tending to ethnicise the campaign instead of making it issue-based. Afenifere has, therefore, decided to address you today and through you educate the public on the ideological and equitable principles which have influenced our decision,”&nbsp;he said.</p><h2>Obasanjo And Osinbajo Are Why Afenifere Won’t Support Tinubu Or Atiku</h2><p>Explaining his statement on why Tinubu cannot be supported, Adebanjo said Afenifere and the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum had before now unanimously proposed that the minimum condition for a peaceful transition from the disastrous eight years of Buhari’s government headed by a President of northern extraction was to have the next President from the South.</p><p>He noted the position was supported by southern governors, irrespective of their political parties.</p><p>He recalled that the Southwest had taken the first turn at the zoning arrangement in 1999 when the country was led by Chief Olusegun Obasanjo. He also noted that the current Vice President is a Yoruba man and equity forbids us them to presume to support another Yoruba person for the presidency in 2023.</p><p>Adebanjo said: “The current President is a Fulani from the North-West and by virtue of the zoning arrangement that has governed Nigeria since 1999, power is supposed to return to the south imminently.</p><p>“The South-West, as I have pointed out, has produced a president and currently sits as VP, the South-South has spent a total of six years in the Presidency, but the Igbo people of the South-East have never tasted presidency in Nigeria, and now that the power is due back in the South, equity demands that it be ceded to the Igbo.</p><p>“We cannot continue to demand that the Igbo people remain in Nigeria, while we at the same time continue to brutally marginalise and exclude them from the power dynamics.</p><p>Adebanjo, therefore, condemned the ceding of the PDP presidential ticket to “a Northern Fulani Muslim to succeed General Muhammadu Buhari, another Fulani Muslim, who will soon complete eight years of uneventful and disastrous rule. One can imagine such a high degree of political insensitivity.”</p><p>He stressed that the group would not jettison equity, inclusiveness and justice just because one of their own [Tinubu] was in the contest.</p><p>“We will not compromise this principle of justice, equity and inclusiveness because one of our own Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is a frontline candidate,” Adebanjo said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FvZqirmaOvorbOZqabmaOWu6u7jJqpnmWimq60u82sZLCgqWKup7HNop2eqpVixLC602aqrqigpL%2B1edOipa6apWKutbXKrmSanJWXrq%2B2zmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-robert-zane-on-suits.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened to Robert Zane on 'Suits'?
