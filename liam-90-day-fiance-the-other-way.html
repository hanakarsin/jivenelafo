It's unbelievable," the personal trainer laments on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an upcoming episode</a>. "[It bothers] me because [he hasn’t shown] up for two days [of] my wedding. It's weird, right?"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Liam doesn’t approve of Laura and Aladin’s marriage on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way.</h2><p>Though he initially told his mom that he wouldn’t be attending her wedding, Liam decided to make the trip, but hasn’t felt like participating in the festivities. "I don't like Aladin, but there's just no way that I can convey that without coming across as rude or mean or as just an overall d--k," he admits in a clip.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>The Toronto native has been skeptical of Aladin from the start. "I don’t understand what [he] hopes to get out of this," Liam previously stated in a confessional.&nbsp;</p><p>"There’s such a huge age gap and it’s almost as if Aladin’s wasting time. I mean she can’t have children. I will never accept him as a father figure. He’s kind of getting the short end of the stick on this."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Liam seemingly hinted that he’s now estranged from Laura.</h2><p>In July, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soap Dirt</a> discovered a social media post allegedly written by Liam that claims he’s moving back to Canada. "OK so here’s the situation," he begins. "For reasons I can’t disclose I am leaving Florida and moving back to Canada to be closer to my family."</p><p>He goes on to say, "My mother is unable to help me anymore so I can’t afford to live here in Eustis by myself so I’m going back to Canada and [will] hopefully get my LPN (licensed practical nurse certification). I have my grandmother, father, brothers, and more family so I will be safe and have places to live."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Sounds like Liam is struggling with some abandonment issues.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Laura shot down divorce rumors after Aladin deleted all photos of her.</h2><p>On Sept. 14, the 51-year-old addressed reports that the couple had separated. Next to a picture of the duo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Instagram</a>, Laura wrote, "OK, thirsty women and you all say we are divorced! We are not divorced we are together and love each other very, very much!"</p><p>The retiree went on to explain why her husband has no photos of her on his account. "[Aladin] removed my pics because he got sick and tired of you all putting me down," she said. "I'm so sorry, thirsty women but [Aladin] is my husband... I love him he loves me so get over it already let us enjoy our life."</p><p>We hope Liam is still a big part of that life.
