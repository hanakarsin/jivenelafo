Nonetheless, he is likely to be fired anyway because he has demonstrated his political partisanship as an APC member.</p><p>An increasing number of cabinet members including Minister of Labour and Productivity <strong>Chris Ngige</strong>, and the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), <strong>Abubakar Malami</strong>, have abandoned their political ambitions after Buhari instructed all candidates to resign their portfolios by May 16.</p><p>Ngige had purchased the presidential nomination forms, while Malami had obtained the ones for the Kebbi State gubernatorial election. The fear of losing their powerful jobs appears to have compelled them to reconsider their quest.</p><p>However, a number of cabinet colleagues, including Minister of Transportation <strong>Chibuike Amaechi</strong>, have resigned so that they can run for one of the posts in next year’s general election.</p><p>‘’There is a growing likelihood that neither APC nor the main opposition PDP will win the 2023 national elections on the first ballot and that regional parties will subsequently emerge.</p><p>‘’The APC’s overwhelming dominance is likely to dwindle; the PDP is likely to remain in its South-South strongholds; while the smaller parties will be strong in specific states and the National Assembly’’, the intelligence report says.</p><p>Continuing, it said Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje’s Chief of Staff announced his defection to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) on May 14. He is the state’s latest high-profile defector to the NNPP which gained popularity after its 1999-2003 and 2011-2015 governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, defected from the PDP.</p><p>NNPP recently welcomed <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Abdulmumin Jibrin</a></strong> — Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s campaign director general in the North — who defected from the APC to the NNPP despite pleas from Tinubu not to do so.</p><p>Fourteen PDP members in Kano State’s House of Assembly have subsequently defected to the NNPP which has transformed into the major opposition in Kano which, after Lagos, has the second largest number of voters and but boasts the highest turnout.</p><p>Because of Kwankwaso’s popularity in many parts of the North, the party could become the party of choice for potential defectors from both the APC and the PDP which makes the NNPP a force to be reckoned with in 2023.</p><p>‘’NNPP now also has a good chance of winning Kano State in next year’s gubernatorial election thanks to Kwankwaso’s support — because the APC appears increasingly divided in the state — and may also become a strong contender in other northern states’’, adds the report.</p><p>The emerging shape of the country’s new politics is the likelihood of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) winning more states in the South-East if both the APC and the PDP fail to field an Igbo candidate.</p><p>NNPP is also tipped to win Kano and some states in the core North as well as the Social Democratic Party (SDP) possibly winning some states in the South-West, after the defection of some APC bigwigs if Lawan is selected as the party’s candidate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FrZqKmpJq5rbXGnqWcnV2nsrG70a1knrCgoa6qutJmrqGxXaGuuK3NZqGooZ6asW6tz5xkqaqVqLalsc2toJqkXaeupLGO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./410945-tears-love-flow-family-forgives-man-who-killed-their-son-you-brother-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tears of Love Flow as Family Forgives Man Who Killed Their Son: &amp;quot;You're Our Brother&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-alexander-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Alexander - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
