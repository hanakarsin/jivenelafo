That season also offered a glimpse into the lives of <a href=#>Nathan Prater</a> and <a href=#>Ontreon Shannon</a>.</p><p>Before Julian sought help from <a href=#>Dr. Now</a>, his life revolved around food. His now ex-wife, Irma (more on that below), even had to assist him with showering. During his initial visit with Dr. Now, Julian weighed in at 830 pounds. With a desire to regain control of his life and be the husband his wife wanted and deserved, Julian was ready to make some major changes. So, how much weight did he lose and where is he today? Here‚Äôs an update!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Julian Valentine from ‚ÄòMy 600-lb Life Now‚Äô?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Julian is still still living in Houston after moving there from Tucson. He also continues to lose weight. Since appearing on the show, and returning for Season 9, Episode 3, of <a href=#>My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now?</a>, which aired on May 15, 2024, Julian has lost a total of 279 pounds. A quick scroll through his social media accounts reveals he‚Äôs still working hard at reaching his target weight.</p><p>During filming for the May 2024 episode, Julian revealed that he had secured a full-time, salaried job in tech support with benefits. However, it isn't clear if he‚Äôs still working in the same role.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Julian made a lot of progress with Dr. Now‚Äôs help.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@julianmlv2.0 href=#>@julianmlv2.0</a><p><a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=kingbiggie22 href=#>#kingbiggie22</a> <a title=moonstrongüåô href=#>#moonstrongüåô</a> <a title=positivity href=#>#positivity</a> <a title=viralvideos href=#>#viralvideos</a> <a title=love href=#>#Love</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#FYP</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Million dollar baby - Tommy Richman" href=#>‚ô¨ Million dollar baby - Tommy Richman</a></figure><p>Two months after his initial visit with Dr. Now, Julian weighed 714 pounds, prompting the doctor to approve him for his move to Houston. Although the move was quite stressful as an axle on their trailer broke while they were en route, resulting in the couple having to leave behind the bulk of their belongings on the side of the road, they got through it.</p><p>By the time Julian made it back into Dr. Now‚Äôs office, he was 705 pounds and qualified for weight loss surgery. That helped him shed even more weight, with the scale reading 639 pounds 12 months after his initial visit. Although Julian remained committed to a strict diet and exercise regime (with a few vulnerable moments along the way), things were going well.</p><p>A year and five months after meeting Dr. Now, Julian and Irma were able to adopt his sister‚Äôs son, Saamir, who was around 9 months old at the time. Three months later, Julian weighed 551 pounds, reflecting a total weight loss of 279 pounds. Although Dr. Now advised Julian to continue losing weight so he could undergo skin removal surgery, it‚Äôs unclear if he was able to do so.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Julian Valentine‚Äôs childhood issues may be the source of his eating problems.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>While on his journey to leading a better life, Julian met with Dr. Matthew Paradise to discuss the root of his eating issue. Julian explained that when he was younger, his stepdad didn‚Äôt treat him very well, to say the least. He recalled him taking away Christmas and prohibiting him and his sisters from going into the kitchen.</p><p>As an alternative, he provided them with just a microwave, restricting them to only eating frozen meals. As conditions worsened, Julian‚Äôs mom kicked Julian out of the house, essentially choosing her husband over him.</p><p>Julian then went to live with his grandma where he began to gain weight, thanks to her generous cooking. But, sometime later, Julian got a call from his mom asking him to aid her in removing his stepdad from the residence. Upon his arrival, his stepdad pulled a gun on him, although SWAT intervened.</p><p>It seems the lack of food and the replenishment of it while living with his grandmother led Julian to develop a habit of "stockpiling," aka overeating, as Dr. Paradise explained, eventually getting to him an unhealthy weight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Are Julian and Irma still together?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>Somewhere along the way in Julian‚Äôs weight loss journey, he and Irma separated. So sadly, no, Julian and Irma are no longer together. However, he appears to have moved on with another woman who goes by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TenaciousMoon</a> on TikTok. In the comments section of a TikTok video posted on April 7, 2024, a fan accused Julian of shedding a few pounds and leaving his wife, to which he replied, ‚ÄúEverything you see on TV is not what it seems. FYI she left me. Next time don‚Äôt just assume.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chynnag69 href=#>@chynnag69</a><p>Why waste a view lol Follow Me! üòÅü´∂üèΩ‚ÄºÔ∏è <a title=followtrain href=#>#followtrain</a> <a title=nice href=#>#nice</a> <a title=love href=#>#love</a> <a title=entertainment href=#>#entertainment</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=loveyou href=#>#loveyou</a> <a title=healthy href=#>#healthy</a> <a title=blessed href=#>#blessed</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=mightaswell href=#>#mightaswell</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Chelsey" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Chelsey</a></figure><p>The back and forth continued with Julian‚Äôs new lady stepping in. ‚ÄúYou fell for the TV act too huh, loud and wrong.
