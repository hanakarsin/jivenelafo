She's the British Björk, or Fiona Apple if you will. Some have, too, compared her to Tori Amos, but when it comes down to it, Grammy-nominated artist Kate Bush is in a realm of her own. A true original. The pop culture icon embraced her oddities, her mime-like dance moves, and her almost ghostly quirks and applied them to her songwriting and singing gifts, creating a legacy that continues to resonate with people from all walks of life (especially the <a href=#>LGBTQ+</a> community).</p><p>After she released her self-composed debut hit "Wuthering Heights" at 19 years old in 1978, the song topped the U.K. Singles Chart for four straight weeks. Ever since then, '80s tunes like "Babooshka" (oh hey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>!) and "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Running Up That Hill</a>" have cemented her as an international pop culture icon. And considering <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s cherished sci-fi series <a href=#>Stranger Things</a> is set in the mid-'80s, it's not super surprising that 1985's "Running Up That Hill" was featured in Season 4. It first popped up in Episode 1, titled "Chapter 1: The Hellfire Club" (as it should).</p><p>It's Max's (Sadie Sink) favorite song, and the first episode showcases her listening to the '80s pop hit on her Walkman, as the tune is significant to her storyline. Season 4 premiered on Friday, May 27, 2022, and by Monday, May 30, "Running Up That Hill" "was No. 1 on the iTunes song chart and No. 13 on Spotify's top 200," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>Now that the powerful tune is back in the limelight, let's discuss the history of Kate Bush's beloved single.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Kate Bush in East Wickham, London, circa 1978</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kate Bush's "Running Up That Hill" was the first single on her 1985 album 'Hounds of Love.'</h2><p>Let's catch up on our herstory. One of Kate Bush's most memorable songs, it was originally titled "A Deal with God," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The National</a>. It first hit the radio on Aug. 5, 1985, in the U.K. According to the publication, "it peaked at No. 3 on the U.K. charts and made 30 in the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S." at the time.</p><p>Understandably, her label had her change the name of the song, as its religious implications may not have done well in hyper-religious countries.</p><p>“You see, for me it is still called 'A Deal With God,' that was its title. But we were told that if we kept this title that it would not be played in any of the religious countries," she relayed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC Radio 1’s Richard Skinner in 1992</a>. "Italy wouldn’t play it, France wouldn’t play it, and Australia wouldn’t play it! Ireland wouldn’t play it, and that generally, we might get it blacked purely because it had God in the title."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>One thing Stranger Things gets absolutely right is the life saving power of Kate Bush’s Running Up That Hill</p>— Maria Dieters ☘️ (@mariadieters) <a href=#>May 29, 2022</a></figure><p>It practically killed Kate to change the title, but she knew she had to choose her battles.</p><p>"This seemed completely ridiculous to me and the title was such a part of the song’s entity. I just couldn’t understand it. But nonetheless, although I was very unhappy about it, I felt unless I compromised that I was going to be cutting my own throat, you know? I’d just spent two, three years making an album and we weren’t gonna get this record played on the radio, if I was stubborn."</p><p>However, the album still has it titled as "Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is "Running Up That Hill" about?</h2><p>Overall, the song sees a woman wishing she could make a deal with God to swap places with a man and get a better understanding for him.</p><p>“It's about a relationship between a man and a woman,” Kate Bush explained in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1985 interview</a>. “They love each other very much, and the power of the relationship is something that gets in the way. It creates insecurities."</p><p>“It’s saying if the man could be the woman and the woman the man, if they could make a deal with God, to change places, that they’d understand what it’s like to be the other person and perhaps it would clear up misunderstandings. You know, all the little problems; there would be no problem.”</p><p>She thought making a deal with God would be much more powerful than making a deal with the devil.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i just have to say the inclusion of kate bush’s running up that hill (a deal with god) in stranger things 4 episode 4 changed the trajectory of my life and permanently altered my brain chemistry thank you kate bush thank you sadie sink</p>— ⁂ (@gob1inatrix) <a href=#>May 28, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It was Winona Ryder's idea to include "Running Up That Hill" in Season 4.</h2><p>Oscar nominee Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands) — who plays Joyce Byers — really pushed to have Kate Bush's synthy music featured in Season 4.</p><p>"I've been obsessed with her since I was a little girl," Winona said in a recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with USA Today</a>.
