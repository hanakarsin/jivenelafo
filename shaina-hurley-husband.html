But while they initially seemed to have a connection in the pods, things went south after they met in person. One thing Shaina took issue with was Kyle's being an atheist, as she is a devoted Christian. The two broke up during their season.</p><p>After filming ended, Shaina went on to date Christos Lardakis. He even appeared alongside Shaina as her fiancé in Love Is Blind: After the Altar. The two tied the knot in July 2022, and have since gone on to expand their family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Shaina’s husband, Christos Lardakis?</h2><p>Christos is the owner of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanela Breakfast Club</a>, a Greek-inspired restaurant with locations in the Chicago metropolitan area. In addition to serving as a restaurateur, Chris is a general contractor. He owns and operates <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CL Development</a>, which provides construction services for commercial and residential properties.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Shaina Hurley had actually met her now-husband Christos Lardakis before she went on 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><p>Shaina and Christos's first shot at love actually happened before Shaina left to film Love Is Blind.</p><p>The two had met through a mutual friend, but — as <a href=#>Christos previously told Distractify in a joint interview with Shaina</a> — he'd had "a lot on [his] plate" at the time, and wasn't ready for a relationship. He was dealing with business and family issues.</p><p>They split for a time — leaving Shaina to join Love Is Blind and providing Christos with more time to focus on his personal life.</p><p>But after Shaina was done filming, they eventually reconnected when they both ended up at a mutual pal's wedding in Greece. And the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>"We both aligned on the same idea — hers is 'faith first,' mine is, too," Christos told us. "That initially connected us, and, after that, I couldn't stop looking at her."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Shaina Hurley welcomed a baby with husband Christos Lardakis in February 2024.</h2><p>Christos had already become a father when his ex welcomed their daughter Axelle in 2020.
