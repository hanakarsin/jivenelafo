The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After We Collided </a>trailer just hit the internet, and fans are curious when they‚Äôre going to be able to see the finished film. As the trailer dropped, fans also got an answer to that question, although it may not be the one that many of them were hoping for with regards to <a href=#>Netflix</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is ‚ÄòAfter We Collided‚Äô going to be on Netflix?</h2><p>Although many of the movie‚Äôs biggest fans were hoping to catch the sequel on <a href=#>Netflix</a>, the movie won‚Äôt hit the platform when it‚Äôs first released.&nbsp;Instead, the movie is set to be released in theaters and on Video on Demand on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oct. 2.</a> The VOD release comes as most movie theaters across the country are still shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is ‚ÄòAfter We Collided‚Äô about?</h2><p>After We Collided is an adaptation of the sequel novel to After, and the movie will likely feature a lot of the same major elements of the plot as the book. In the trailer, we see that Tessa and Hardin, played by Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin, are still drawn to one another even in the aftermath of their breakup in the first movie.&nbsp;</p><p>The movie will explore whether Tessa and Hardin should still be together after their breakup, and it seems like the answer to that question is likely to be yes. The second film will also add some complications to their story, though, in the form of new characters. One, played by Dylan Sprouse, will be Tessa‚Äôs new love interest, and The Vampire Diaries‚Äô Candice King will also join the cast as Tessa‚Äôs boss.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans are thrilled about the new 'After We Collided' trailer.</h2><p>Although they may not get to see it on <a href=#>Netflix</a> in the immediate future, fans are thrilled to have at least a teaser of the new film. ‚ÄúOH MY GOD, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I DON'T EVEN NOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS IN FRONT OF MY EYES like WOW. THIS IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. MASTERPIECE. THIS IS BOOK HESSA.
