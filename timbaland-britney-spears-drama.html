The pair just started dating when they were 18 years old and 17 years old, respectively.</p><p>Britney talks about her relationship with Justin in The Woman in Me, shockingly telling the world that the pair had been pregnant and that <a href=#>she got an abortion</a> after much convincing from Justin. She wrote that Justin "said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young."</p><p>We do want to point out that Justin hasn't commented on the book yet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Timbaland says Justin Timberlake should have put a “muzzle” on Britney Spears, following the release of her memoir:</p><p>“I wanted to call JT and say 'Man! You should have put a muzzle on that girl.'”</p><p><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vigncOOXLG</a></p>— Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href=#>November 7, 2023</a></figure><p>So, how does Timbaland come into play here? Well, Timbaland was on stage at 'Sounds Architects: A Producer Conversation' at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. when he was asked about the book by a fan.</p><p>In the video above, Timbaland says, "I wanted to call and say, 'JT, you gotta put a muzzle on that girl.'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> also reported that he said, "He doesn't blame Britney for having loose lips, because that's what you have to do to go viral, and that's the name of the game in the current social media era of showbiz."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@lootmtaylor</a></figure><p>Another person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, "Timbaland is the one who needs a muzzle. We didn’t forget about his gross Aaliyah comments. He's still upset Britney didn’t want to work with him. A nasty man." The event referenced here is when Timbaland said he was in love with Aaliyah even though she was 16, and he was 23 at the time.</p><p>Britney Spears hasn't made a statement about the comment, and Timbaland hasn't apologized yet but we are sure (or at least hoping) that the latter is imminent.</p><p>Be sure to check out Britney's book, The Woman in Me, wherever books are sold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaursClmKecXZe%2FqsDNnrBmq6CarrO%2FjJ2pmqWR</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-was-inn-love-by-christmas-filmed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Inn Love by Christmas' Is a Classic Holiday Romance With an Authentic Location</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./247818-kenyans-enjoy-cheap-ugali-unga-crisis-finally-end-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenyans enjoy cheap ugali as Unga crisis finally comes to an end</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
