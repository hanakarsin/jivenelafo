So, which contestant is it? Here's everything you need to know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Get ready guys because <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> will be back next on May 13 to sate all of your dating drama needs. And from what we can tell from teaser <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clips</a> released ahead of next week's premiere, the ABC show is going to deliver more than we even signed up for. That's because former pageant queen <a href=#>Hannah Brown </a>might be kicking off her season with a huge confrontation.</p><p>"You know that Bachelorette drama you can't wait for?" a narrator says in the clip. "Well, Monday, May 13 it all starts happening night one."</p><p>In the teaser, we see Hannah confront one of the 33 contestants vying for her love. "You have a girlfriend!" she says to one of the guys.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So who has a girlfriend on The Bachelorette?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The contestant with a secret girlfriend is Scott A.</h2><p>This wouldn't be the first time someone came onto the franchise with a significant other back home. Just recently, <a href=#>Tayshia had a secret boyfriend</a> while competing for Colton Underwoods's affection and attention on The Bachelor.&nbsp;</p><p>Before that we watched DeMario Jackson go off on former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay about his off-camera girlfriend, which ultimately got him sent packing.&nbsp;</p><p>And who can forget when Ali Fedotowsky confronted Justin, who had been dating someone for two years when he appeared on the reality dating competition? That was so spectacularly messy, it ended with Justin trying to escape through the bushes on crutches. Oh dear.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Bachelorette / Facebook</span></figure><p>So when we heard one of the guys was coming to the Agoura Hills mansion with a girlfriend on the DL, we already knew it was going to be cause for disaster. The offending contestant is Scott A., and as far as we can tell, he has no public social media presence.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is smart because you know we'd be posting pictures of his GF if we could find them! Anyway, this Chicago native is something of a heartthrob judging from the number of Bachelorette fans who've taken to Facebook to post roses on his photo. However, we wouldn't want to be him on the first night dealing with Hannah's wrath.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Scott A. make it to Hannah's Final Four? (SPOILERS)</h2><p>Stop reading if you don't want to know how the season ends. But if you're anything like us and want to go into the next few weeks knowing about all the behind-the-scenes drama, stay with us. As usual, there are <a href=#>four lucky guys Hannah will be taking out on hometown dates</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>In the clip ahead of next week's premiere, we hear an exasperated Hannah say, "I want somebody to fight for me. That's what I deserve." Get it, girl! We're thinking that a guy who's spoken for and still decided to go on a reality show probably won't be the guy to fight for her, if we're being honest.</p><p>As it were, the four lucky guys who make it to the final and most riveting step on The Bachelorette are <a href=#>Jed Wyatt</a>, Luke Parker, Peter Weber, and <a href=#>Tyler Cameron</a>. Luke managed to win <a href=#>Hannah's first impression rose</a> really early on and we're thinking he might just be her One.</p><p>If you want more spoilers for this season of The Bachelorette, <a href=#>click here</a>.</p><p>We'll be seeing the rest of you on Monday, May 13 when The Bachelorette premieres at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWweceaqmafmae5p77InqWdZZKWsKmxy6ipnqykmg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./actress-ayo-adesanya-reveals-why-she-rejects-movie-roles.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Actress, Ayo Adesanya Reveals Why She Rejects Movie Roles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tana-mongeau.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tana Mongeau Latest News and Updates</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
