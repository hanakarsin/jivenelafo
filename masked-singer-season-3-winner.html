That's because the Fox singing competition had the advantage of wrapping up filming back in February. (You know, before the novel coronavirus pandemic shut down the entire nation.)</p><p>Now, in the blink of an eye, Season 3 has come to an end. But who took home the golden mask trophy on The Masked Singer Season 3? Let's take a closer look at the top three contestants â€” as well as whether it was the Frog, the Turtle, or the Night Angel who was declared the winner.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">'The Masked Singer' Season 3 finale featured a different format than usual.</h2><p>The novel coronavirus pandemic forced producers of The Masked Singer to switch up both the schedule and format for Season 3. Likely because the April 15 singalong episode had mixed reviews, the finale date was bumped up a week from May 27 to May 20 â€” so fans wouldn't have to wait around another week for more results.</p><p>As for the finale itself, it was actually spread out over two days. The May 19 episode was dubbed, "Road to the Finals," during which no new performances were shown nor were new clues revealed. Instead, viewers essentially got to take a walk down memory lane to see some of the most memorable performances from Season 3.</p><p>During the grand finale on May 20, however, viewers were treated to new performances from the remaining three finalists â€” the Dark Angel, the Turtle, and the Frog. All three contestants were unmasked, too, in addition to the announcement of the Season 3 winner.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Turtle was Jesse McCartney.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: fox</span></figure><p>Not only did the Turtle sound like Jesse from the first performance, but he was roughly the same height as the singer/actor, too. That and every clue pointed back to Jesse â€” like the surfboard, for starters. Jesse not only played a surfer in the series Summerland, but he's taken home three Teen Choice Awards, which happen to be surfboard-shaped. There were also references to his popular song, "Beautiful Soul," and the fact that Jesse was a teen heartthrob.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Frog was Bow Wow.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>All evidence pertaining to the real identify of the Frog pointed to Bow Wow â€” and that's exactly who was behind the mask on May 20. Throughout Season 3, clues hinted to his album "Doggy Bag" and to his appearances on 106 & Park and on CSI: Cyber. Additionally, clues have hinted to his home of Atlanta, Ga.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The Night Angel was Kandi Burruss.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span></figure><p>Yep! The Real Housewives of Atlanta star, Kandi Burruss, was the Night Angel. This shouldn't have come as a huge surprise to avid viewers, considering the plethora of clues that hinted at her music career and business moves. One such clue was about duck bill and gangster grandmas â€” which seemed odd at the time. Except, Kandi co-wrote Destiny Child's "Bills, Bills, Bills," and she owns Atlanta-area restaurants called Old Lady Gang.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who was 'The Masked Singer' Season 3 winner?</h2><p>Although it was thrilling when Nick Cannon revealed who was behind the masks of the Season 3 finalists, even more satisfying was finally knowing who would take home the golden mask trophy. And the Season 3 winner of The Masked Singer was none other than: Night Angel aka Kandi Burruss.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>She's blessed us with her voice all season â€” now show #NightAngelMask some love for her final performance! ðŸ˜‡ #TheMaskedSinger</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>The Masked Singer</a> (@maskedsingerfox) on May 20, 2020 at 5:30pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Twitter reactions to 'The Masked Singer' Season 3 winner were intense.</h2><p>Emotions were running high when the Season 3 winner was announced on The Masked Singer finale. Some Twitter users wholeheartedly agreed with who emerged as the champion. But others? Not so much.
