Fans all over the world loved the show and the fascinating fish tanks.</p><p>The show ran for a remarkable 15 seasons, but many want to know what happened to it, and why there are no new episodes being released. Here's everything we know about what happened to Tanked, and why it's no longer on the air.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Animal Planet</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What happened to the show 'Tanked'?</h2><p>Tanked was ultimately canceled after 15 seasons on the air back in 2019. "After 15 fantastic seasons the series came to a natural end late last year," the network announced at the time.</p><p>The show's ending came amid drama between one of the hosts and his estranged wife, but that drama wasn't the ultimate reason for the show's demise. Instead, it was the simple reality that the show's ratings were no longer as good as they had once been.</p><p>According to TMZ, the decision to end the show was made months before a domestic violence incident between the show's stars, Heather and Wayde King. Heather was arrested for domestic violence at the time after she reportedly kicked Wayde and hit him in the stomach following a heated argument. Wayde also claimed that she had him hanging out the window of their car, and Heather filed for divorce two days later.</p><p>Although Tanked may have been axed either way, it certainly seems like Animal Planet found the right time to bring the show to an end, and avoided having to cancel it solely because its hosts were no longer on speaking terms. Wayde and Heather have both receded from the spotlight in the years since the show ended, which makes sense given the high-profile nature of their divorce.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-cbeQSR faRvJV"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">'Tanked' has found a second life on streaming.</h2><p>Although the show that aired on Animal Planet has been over since 2019, Tanked has found new life thanks to its availability on several different streaming platforms, including Max and Apple TV+. Thankfully, there are many seasons of the show to get through before you run out, but once you do, you might wind up wondering why they couldn't just keep making it forever.</p><p>There were several pretty solid reasons to end Tanked when they did, and if they ever brought the show back, it seems likely that it would follow a different pair of hosts than it did during its original run on Animal Planet. All the fish nerds out there will have to be satisfied with the seasons they've already got.</p><p>Of course, it's not as if there aren't plenty of shows on streaming that are like Tanked, even if they aren't exactly what this show is. Tanked may be over, but reality TV keeps on churning and spitting out new stuff for us to binge.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoJViwKm71marmqabmrE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./721953-nigerian-shows-electricity-generator-powered-by-water-photos-video-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerian shows electricity generator that is powered by water (photos, video)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./289829-nairobians-angered-by-mike-sonkos-plan-increase-parking-fees-ksh-400-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nairobians angered by Mike Sonko's plan to increase parking fees to KSh 400</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
