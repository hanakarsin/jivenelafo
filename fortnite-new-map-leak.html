Details!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><p>Epic Games' <a href=#>Fortnite</a> still holds the distinction of being one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular video games in the world</a>. As such, when things look like they're about to change in-game, people sit up and pay attention. In Fortnite's case, it looks like Season 11 is just days away. But this time, instead of the game opening up with Season 11 and some new skins, weapons, or areas in the map, players think something even bigger is going to happen. The next phase of Fortnite may finally be upon us.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortnite Intel</a>, a new leak from the Italian iOS App Store just confirmed a new map could finally be coming to the game. Ever since Fortnite debuted, players have been duking it out across the same map, though it's been altered with different areas and permutations over the course of the game's various seasons.&nbsp;Epic Games has yet to say anything about this "new map," but there's an event scheduled for&nbsp;Season 10's "The End" event on Sunday, Oct. 13 at 2 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fortnite Intel</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What does the Fortnite new map leak tell us?</h2><p>Mainly, it looks like the next phase of Fortnite is indeed coming. It looks like Season 10's end will herald the end of several things, notably the end of the game's plot line, the same map that's been available for two years, and the end of Fortnite as we know it. That's in no way a bad thing, because after spending so long on the same map, fans will understandably be ready to jump into a new one.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The End is near.</p><p>48 hours... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yjt1zVXWt6</a></p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href=#>October 11, 2019</a></figure><p>With what the official Fortnite Twitter account has been posting, such as tweets that show characters waving goodbye to the game's Battle Bus and text like "The End is near," it's really making us think. What is it "The End" of? Why is there going to be a special stream for all of it to go down? All signs point to a brand new vision for how the game is meant to be played and what Fortnite enthusiasts can expect from it going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>It's unclear, however, when "the end" will actually come. Epic Games had extended Season 10's current run, adding in new "Out of Time" Overtime challenges for players, with a set of cosmetic rewards and a free loading screen for anyone who completes them. Will "The End" happen after the Overtime Challenges aren't available anymore? Epic Games has remained mum on the situation thus far. Whatever the case may be, it's time some new changes came to Fortnite, as fans will likely eat up what's next.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re heading into overtime!</p><p>The Season X Overtime Challenges have begun.

But most games where multiplayer players battle for supremacy cycle in several different maps to keep things feeling fresh. For both old fans and new,&nbsp;change might actually do this game some good. &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7yzwM2iq55lnprEbrnAqWSlnZGg</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./erika-calabrese-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Erika Calabrese - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chaeryeong-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chaeryeong - Edad, Familia, Biografa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./411613-jubilation-as-liverpool-star-his-girlfriend-edwards-are-set-become-parents-first-time-html.html>Liverpool Star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain Announces Girlfriend Perrie Edwards Is Pregnant</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./messi-joins-inter-miami-on-two-year-contract.html>Messi Joins Inter Miami On Two-Year Contract</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./vote-buying-ogun-pdp-guber-candidate-adebutu-9-others-arraigned-in-court.html>Ogun PDP Guber Candidate, Adebutu, 9 Others Arraigned In Court</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-jane-in-the-vow.html>Who Is &amp;quot;Jane&amp;quot; in 'The Vow'?
